* Re-introduce the distribution name in strings, with `lsb_release --id --short`
* Introduce a trust chain for the downloaded kernel and initrd's (gpg check with embedded archive key)
* Get the language selection dropdown menu translated (get l10n specialists advice on that one)

== Fantasy ==
* Allow kfreebsd-* install
