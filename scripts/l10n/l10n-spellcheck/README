The following files should help translators to find typos in po files:

check_dit.sh 
check_all.sh
lang2dict.txt
msgstr_extract.awk

In order to be able to use all the scripts above you need the following packages:
gnuplot
aspell
aspell-bin
aspell-${DICT}

where ${DICT} is the aspell-suffix (see the second column of lang2dict.txt)


Run the following command in order to spellcheck the languages listed
in lang2dict.txt:

	 sh check_all.sh <D-I repository>


This will create a subdirectory "check_${TODAY}" containing various
files.

check_dit.sh 
	Usage: check_dit <lang> <aspell-suffix> <D-I repository> <out dir>

	is the "heart" of the project: it spell checks one single language of
	installer and writes the results inside an output dir.
	Optional word lists are expected to be found in the "wls" subdir

check_all.sh
	Usage: check_all.sh

	this is the top-level scripts that loops through the languages and
	creates a png graph, a table in text and HTML formats

lang2dict.txt
	contains the language code to aspell-suffix conversion:
	it is used for 
	"pt_BR" --> "pt-br"
	"nb" --> "no"
	"uk" --> "ukr"
	
msgstr_extract.awk
	Usage: find . -name ${LANG}.po |\
	xargs awk -f ~/bin/msgstr_extract > [outputfile]

	script originally sent to me by Frans Pop and slightly modified
	in order to work with all languages

As you can see I'm not an HTML guru! 
It would probably make more sense if the results could be included 
somewhere like
