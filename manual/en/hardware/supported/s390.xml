<para>

Since &debian; Squeeze, support for booting in ESA/390 mode was dropped.  Your
machine needs to support for at least the z/Architecture, Architecture Level
Set 2.  The userland is still compiled for ESA/390, though.  All zSeries
hardware is fully supported.

&arch-title; support software is included from the kernel 2.6.39 development
stream.  The most current information about IBM's Linux support can be found at
the

Linux on <trademark class="registered">System z</trademark> page on
developerWorks</ulink>.

<para>

PAV and HyperPAV are supported transparently, multipathing is not needed to
take advantage of these storage system features.  Be sure to configure the
devices during DASD device selection.  The alias devices will not be
offered neither for formatting, partitioning nor direct use.
