 <title>Booting Into Your New Debian System</title>

 <sect1 id="base-boot"><title>The Moment of Truth</title>
<para>

Your system's first boot on its own power is what electrical engineers
call the <quote>smoke test</quote>.

</para><para arch="x86">

If you did a default installation, the first thing you should see when you
boot the system is the menu of the <classname>grub</classname> or possibly
the <classname>lilo</classname> bootloader.
The first choices in the menu will be for your new Debian system. If you
had any other operating systems on your computer (like Windows) that were
detected by the installation system, those will be listed lower down in the
menu.

</para><para>

If the system fails to start up correctly, don't panic. If the installation
was successful, chances are good that there is only a relatively minor
problem that is preventing the system from booting Debian. In most cases
such problems can be fixed without having to repeat the installation.
One available option to fix boot problems is to use the installer's
built-in rescue mode (see <xref linkend="rescue"/>).

</para><para>

If you are new to Debian and Linux, you may need some help from more
experienced users.
<phrase arch="x86">For direct on-line help you can try the IRC channels
#debian or #debian-boot on the OFTC network. Alternatively you can contact
the <ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">debian-user mailing list</ulink>.</phrase>
<phrase arch="not-x86">For less common architectures like &arch-title;,
your best option is to ask on the
<ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">debian-&arch-listname; mailing
list</ulink>.</phrase>
You can also file an installation report as described in
<xref linkend="submit-bug"/>. Please make sure that you describe your problem
clearly and include any messages that are displayed and may help others to
diagnose the issue.

If you had any other operating systems on your computer that were not detected
or not detected correctly, please file an installation report.

If you have just performed a diskless install on a BVM or Motorola
VMEbus machine: once the system has loaded the
<command>tftplilo</command> program from the TFTP server, from the
<prompt>LILO Boot:</prompt> prompt enter one of:

Go to the directory containing the installation files and start up the
<command>Penguin</command> booter, holding down the
<keycap>command</keycap> key.  Go to the
<userinput>Settings</userinput> dialogue (<keycombo>
<keycap>command</keycap> <keycap>T</keycap> </keycombo>), and locate
the kernel options line which should look like
<userinput>root=/dev/ram ramdisk_size=15000</userinput> or similar.

</para><para>

You need to change the entry to
<userinput>root=/dev/<replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></userinput>.
Replace the <replaceable>yyyy</replaceable> with the Linux name of the
partition onto which you installed the system (e.g.
<filename>/dev/sda1</filename>); you wrote this down earlier.  For users
with tiny screens, adding <userinput>fbcon=font:VGA8x8</userinput> (or
<userinput>video=font:VGA8x8</userinput> on pre-2.6 kernels) may help
readability. You can change this at any time.

</para><para>

If you don't want to start GNU/Linux immediately each time you start,
uncheck the <userinput>Auto Boot</userinput> option. Save your
settings in the <filename>Prefs</filename> file using the
<userinput>Save Settings As Default</userinput> option.

</para><para>

Now select <userinput>Boot Now</userinput> (<keycombo>
<keycap>command</keycap> <keycap>B</keycap> </keycombo>) to start your
freshly installed GNU/Linux instead of the RAMdisk installer system.

</para><para>

Debian should boot, and you should see the same messages as
when you first booted the installation system, followed by some new
messages.

If the machine fails to boot after completing the installation, and
stops with a <prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt, try typing
<userinput>Linux</userinput> followed by &enterkey;. (The default boot
configuration in <filename>quik.conf</filename> is labeled Linux). The
labels defined in <filename>quik.conf</filename> will be displayed if
you press the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key at the <prompt>boot:</prompt>
prompt. You can also try booting back into the installer, and editing
the <filename>/target/etc/quik.conf</filename> placed there by the
<guimenuitem>Install Quik on a Hard Disk</guimenuitem> step. Clues
for dealing with <command>quik</command> are available at
<ulink url="&url-powerpc-quik-faq;"></ulink>.

To boot back into MacOS without resetting the nvram, type
<userinput>bye</userinput> at the OpenFirmware prompt (assuming MacOS
has not been removed from the machine). To obtain an OpenFirmware
prompt, hold down the <keycombo> <keycap>command</keycap>
<keycap>option</keycap> <keycap>o</keycap> <keycap>f</keycap>
</keycombo> keys while cold booting the machine. If you need to reset
the OpenFirmware nvram changes to the MacOS default in order to boot
back to MacOS, hold down the <keycombo> <keycap>command</keycap>
<keycap>option</keycap> <keycap>p</keycap> <keycap>r</keycap>
</keycombo> keys while cold booting the machine.

If you use <command>BootX</command> to boot into the installed system,
just select your desired kernel in the <filename>Linux
Kernels</filename> folder, un-choose the ramdisk option, and add
a root device corresponding to your installation;
e.g. <userinput>/dev/hda8</userinput>.

On G4 machines and iBooks, you can hold down the
<keycap>option</keycap> key and get a graphical screen with a button
for each bootable OS, &debian; will be a button with a small penguin
icon.

If you kept MacOS and at some point it changes the OpenFirmware
<envar>boot-device</envar> variable you should reset OpenFirmware to
its default configuration.  To do this hold down the <keycombo>
<keycap>command</keycap> <keycap>option</keycap> <keycap>p</keycap>
<keycap>r</keycap> </keycombo> keys while cold booting the machine.

</para><para>

The labels defined in <filename>yaboot.conf</filename> will be
displayed if you press the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key at the
<prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt.

</para><para>

Resetting OpenFirmware on G3 or G4 hardware will cause it to boot
&debian; by default (if you correctly partitioned and placed the
Apple_Bootstrap partition first).  If you have &debian; on a SCSI disk
and MacOS on an IDE disk this may not work and you will have to enter
OpenFirmware and set the <envar>boot-device</envar> variable,
<command>ybin</command> normally does this automatically.

</para><para>

After you boot &debian; for the first time you can add any additional
options you desire (such as dual boot options) to
<filename>/etc/yaboot.conf</filename> and run <command>ybin</command>
to update your boot partition with the changed configuration.  Please
read the <ulink url="&url-powerpc-yaboot-faq;">yaboot HOWTO</ulink>

Once your system boots, you'll be presented with the login
prompt.  Log in using the personal login and password you
selected during the installation process. Your system is now ready for use.

If you are a new user, you may want to explore the documentation which
is already installed on your system as you start to use it. There are
currently several documentation systems, work is proceeding on
integrating the different types of documentation. Here are a few
starting points.

</para><para>

Documentation accompanying programs you have installed can be found in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/</filename>, under a subdirectory named after the
program (or, more precise, the Debian package that contains the program).
However, more extensive documentation is often packaged separately in
special documentation packages that are mostly not installed by default.
For example, documentation about the package management tool
<command>apt</command> can be found in the packages
<classname>apt-doc</classname> or <classname>apt-howto</classname>.

</para><para>

In addition, there are some special folders within the
<filename>/usr/share/doc/</filename> hierarchy. Linux HOWTOs are
installed in <emphasis>.gz</emphasis> (compressed) format, in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/HOWTO/en-txt/</filename>. After installing
<classname>dhelp</classname>, you will find a browse-able index of
documentation in <filename>/usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html</filename>.

</para><para>

One easy way to view these documents using a text based browser is to
enter the following commands:

<informalexample><screen>
$ cd /usr/share/doc/
$ w3c .
</screen></informalexample>

The dot after the <command>w3c</command> command tells it to show the
contents of the current directory.

</para><para>

If you have a graphical desktop environment installed, you can also use
its web browser. Start the web browser from the application menu and
enter <userinput>/usr/share/doc/</userinput> in the address bar.

</para><para>

You can also type <userinput>info
<replaceable>command</replaceable></userinput> or <userinput>man
<replaceable>command</replaceable></userinput> to see documentation on
most commands available at the command prompt. Typing
<userinput>help</userinput> will display help on shell commands. And
typing a command followed by <userinput>--help</userinput> will
usually display a short summary of the command's usage. If a command's
results scroll past the top of the screen, type
<userinput>|&nbsp;more</userinput> after the command to cause the results
to pause before scrolling past the top of the screen. To see a list of all
commands available which begin with a certain letter, type the letter
and then two tabs.
