<title>Automating the installation using preseeding</title>

This appendix explains the intricacies of preseeding answers to questions in
&d-i; to automate your installation.

 <title>Introduction</title>
<para>

Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions without having to manually
enter the answers while the installation is running. This makes it possible to
fully automate most types of installation and even offers some features not
available during normal installations.

</para><para>

Using preseeding it is possible to fill in answers to questions asked during
both the first stage of the installation (before the reboot into the new
system) and the second stage.

  <title>Preseeding methods</title>
<para>

There are three methods that can be used for preseeding:
<firstterm>initrd</firstterm>, <firstterm>file</firstterm> and
<firstterm>network</firstterm>. Initrd preseeding will work with any
installation method and supports preseeding of more things, but it requires
the most preparation. File and network preseeding each can be used with
different installation methods. With file and network preseeding the first
few installer questions cannot be preseeded because the preseed configuration
file is only loaded after they have been asked.

</para><para>

The following table shows which preseeding methods can be used with which
installation methods.

</para><para>

An important difference between the preseeding methods is the point at which
the preseed configuration file is loaded and processed. For initrd preseeding
this is right at the start of the installation, before the first question is
even asked. For file preseeding this is after the CD or CD image has been
loaded. For network preseeding it is only after the network has been
configured.

</para><para>

In practical terms this means for file and network preseeding that the
questions about language, country and keyboard selection will already have
been asked. For network preseeding add to that any questions related to
network configuration. Some other questions that are only displayed
at medium or low priority (like the first hardware detection run) will
also already have been processed.

</para><para>

Obviously, any questions that have been processed before the
preseeding configuration file is loaded, cannot be preseeded.
<xref linkend="preseed-bootparms"/> offers a way to avoid these
questions being asked.

  <sect2 id="preseed-limitations">
  <title>Limitations</title>
<para>

Although most questions used by &d-i; can be preseeded using this method,
there are some notable exceptions. You must (re)partition an entire disk
or use available free space on a disk; it is not possible to use existing
partitions. You currently cannot use preseeding to set up RAID and LVM.

  <sect2 id="preseed-debconf">
  <title>Debconf basics</title>
<para>

Preseeding makes use of the <classname>debconf</classname> framework. This
framework is the preferred mechanism used in Debian to interact with the user
when configuring packages and also forms the heart of &d-i;.
In the <classname>debconf</classname> framework questions or dialogs are
based on <firstterm>templates</firstterm>. There are different types of
templates for different types of questions. The actual questions are
<quote>generated</quote> from templates at runtime;  multiple questions can
use the same template.

</para><para>

The following types of templates are relevant for preseeding.

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
  string: allows the user to type any value
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  password: similar to string but the value typed is not displayed
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  boolean: for yes/no or true/false type of questions
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  select: allows the user to select one option from a list
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  multiselect: allows the user to select zero, one or more options from a list
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  note: used to display a message
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>

In &d-i; templates are stored in a readable file
<filename>/var/cache/debconf/templates.dat</filename>. This file contains all fixed
text and all translations. It can also contain a default value for the
template. The fixed text can include variables that will be replaced at
runtime.

</para><para>

Another readable file <filename>/var/cache/debconf/questions.dat</filename>
is used to store the values for variables and the answers given to questions.
A question always refers to the template used to ask it. For obvious
security reasons the values for templates of type <quote>password</quote>
are stored in a separate, non-readable file in the same directory.

 <title>Using preseeding</title>
<para>

Of course you will first need to create a preseed file and place it in the
location from where you want to use it. Creating the preseed file is covered
later in this appendix. Putting it in the correct location is fairly
straightforward for network preseeding or if you want to read the file off
a floppy or usb-stick. If you want to include the file on a CD or DVD, you
will have to remaster the ISO image. How to get the preseed file included
in the initrd is outside the scope of this document; please consult the
developers documentation for &d-i;.

</para><para>

An example preseed file that you can use as basis for your preseed file is
available from &urlset-example-preseed;. This file is based on the
configuration fragments included in this appendix.

</para>

  <sect2 id="preseed-loading">
  <title>Loading the preseed file</title>
<para>

If you are using initrd preseeding, you only have to make sure a file named
<filename>preseed.cfg</filename> is included in the root directory of the
initrd. The installer will automatically check if this file is present and
load it.

</para><para>

For the other preseeding methods you need to tell the installer what file to
use when you boot it. This is done by passing the kernel a boot parameter,
either manually at boot time or by editing the bootloader configuration file
(e.g. <filename>syslinux.cfg</filename>) and adding the parameter to the end
of the append line(s) for the kernel.

</para><para>

If you do specify the preseed file in the bootloader configuration, you might
change the configuration so you don't need to hit enter to boot the installer.
For syslinux this means setting the timeout to 1 in
<filename>syslinux.cfg</filename>.

</para><para>

To make sure the installer gets the right preseed file, you can optionally
specify a checksum for the file. Currently this needs to be a md5sum, and if
specified it must match the preseed file or the installer will refuse to use it.

</para>

<informalexample><screen>
Boot parameters to specify:
- if you're netbooting:
  preseed/url=http://host/path/to/preseed.cfg
  preseed/url/checksum=5da499872becccfeda2c4872f9171c3d

- if you're booting a remastered CD:
  preseed/file=/cdrom/preseed.cfg
  preseed/file/checksum=5da499872becccfeda2c4872f9171c3d

- if you're installing from USB media (put the preseed file in the
  toplevel directory of the USB stick):
  preseed/file=/hd-media/preseed.cfg
  preseed/file/checksum=5da499872becccfeda2c4872f9171c3d
</screen></informalexample>

<para>

While you're at it, you may want to add a boot parameter
<userinput>debconf/priority=critical</userinput>. This will avoid most
questions even if the preseeding below misses some.

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="preseed-bootparms">
  <title>Using boot parameters to supplement preseeding</title>
<para>

Some parts of the installation process cannot be automated using some forms
of preseeding because the questions are asked before the preseed file is
loaded. For example, if the preseed file is downloaded over the network,
the network setup must be done first. One reason to use initrd preseeding
is that it allows preseeding of even these early steps of the installation
process.

</para><para>

If a preseed file cannot be used to preseed some steps, the install can
still be fully automated, since you can pass preseed values to the kernel
on the command line. Just pass <userinput>path/to/var=value</userinput>
for any of the preseed variables listed in the examples.

</para>
<note><para>

The 2.4 kernel accepts a maximum of 8 command line options and
8 environment options (including any options added by default for the
installer). If these numbers are exceeded, 2.4 kernels will drop any
excess options and 2.6 kernels will panic. For kernel 2.6.9 and later,
you can use 32 command line options and 32 environment options.

</para></note>
<para>

For most installations some of the default options in your bootloader
configuration file, like 'vga=normal', may be safely removed which may
allow you to add more options for preseeding.

It may not always be possible to specify values with spaces for boot
parameters, even if you delimit them with quotes.

To specify the locale as a boot parameter, use

Keyboard configuration consists of selecting a keyboard architecture and a
keymap. In most cases the correct keyboard architecture is selected by
default, so there's normally no need to preseed it. The keymap must
be valid for the selected  keyboard architecture.

<informalexample role="example"><screen>
# Keyboard selection.

  <title>Partitioning</title>
<para>

Using preseeding to partition the harddisk is very much limited to what is
supported by <classname>partman-auto</classname>. You can choose to either
partition existing free space on a disk or a whole disk. The layout of the
disk can be determined by using a predefined recipe, a custom recipe from
a recipe file or a recipe included in the preseed file. It is currently not
possible to partition multiple disks using preseeding nor to set up RAID or
LVM.

The identification of disks is dependent on the order in which their drivers
are loaded. If there are multiple disks in the system, make very sure the
correct one will be selected before using preseeding.

and force the installation of a set of packages in some other way. We recommend
always including the <userinput>Standard system</userinput> task.

Preseeding Debian's X config is possible, but you probably need to know
some details about the video hardware of the machine, since Debian's X
configurator does not do fully automatic configuration of everything.

# A caveat with mouse autodetection is that if it fails, X will retry it
# over and over. So if it's preseeded to be done, there is a possibility of
# an infinite loop if the mouse is not autodetected.

# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks

# a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
# automatically.

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after
# preseeding is read.

It is possible to include other preseed files from a preseed file. Any
settings in those files will override pre-existing settings from files
loaded earlier. This makes it possible to put, for example, general
networking settings for your location in one file and more specific
settings for certain configurations in other files.

</para>

<informalexample><screen>
# More that one file can be listed, separated by spaces; all will be
# loaded. The included files can have preseed/include directives of their
# own as well. Note that if the filenames are relative, they are taken from
# the same directory as the preseed file that includes them.
#d-i preseed/include string x.cfg

# The installer can optionally verify checksums of preseed files before
# using them. Currently only md5sums are supported, list the md5sums
# in the same order as the list of files to include.
#d-i preseed/include/checksum string 5da499872becccfeda2c4872f9171c3d

# More flexibly, this runs a shell command and if it outputs the names of
# preseed files, includes those files.
