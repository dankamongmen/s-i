autopartkit (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reduce minimum sizes for default partition table.
  * Added Norwegian Bokmål translations recieved from Bjørn Steensrud.
  * Use normalize_devfs() from mapdevfs.  It supports more devices.
  * When creating LVM partitions, first create linux-swap instead of

  * Zero out the start of new LVM partitions to make sure no old header
    will confuse and crash vgscan.
  * Use volume group name as the mounting point for LVM partitions.
  * Reenable separate /usr/ partition.  It works if /bin/sh is dash
    instead of bash.

    - Use asprintf.  Patch from Guillem Jover.
    - Include <unistd.h> in dumptable.c to avoid compile warning.

      All archs supported by libparted should work.
    - Add configure flag --enable-lvm to be able to create LVM parititons.

  * Change standards-version from 3.5.2 to 3.5.8.
  * Typo.  Print disk label as string, not integer.
  * Add depend on new package libparted1.6-udeb, replacing di-fake.

 -- Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Dec 2002 23:50:34 +0100

autopartkit (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove depends on di-fake and profilechooser, since those aren't in
    Debian.
  * André Luís Lopes :
    - Sync pt_BR template translation with the latest english.
  * Use 'GPT' as default disk label type on ia64.
  * Refuse to compile if libparted is missing.
  * Rename debconf_* functions to mydebconf_*, to avoid conflict with
    upcoming cdebconf.
  * Print config.log if configure fails.  This will help me debug the
    build problem on the mipsel buildd.
  * More code cleanup to avoid compile warnings.

 -- Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>  Fri, 13 Dec 2002 13:51:08 +0100

autopartkit (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get the package working with libparted 1.6.
  * Change default file system from ext3 to ext2.  I was wrong
    thinking ext3 was supported in libparted 1.6.
  * Add forgotten postinst script.
  * Make it easier to select default disk label type at run time.
  * Use 'msdos' disk label type on platforms where the proper type is
    unknown.  This avoids a compile error on these platforms.
  * Log default disk label type.
  * Code cleanup to avoid some compile warnings.
  * Reinsert versioned depend on po-debconf.  This will make sure the
    templates use UTF-8.
  * Add more specific depend for virtual package libcdebconf-dev.
  * Remove yes/no from autopartkit/confirm template, correct spelling.
  * Make sure PED_DONE() is called on successful termination.

autopartkit (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Development version moved from Skolelinux into Debian CVS.  Skipping
    version numbers 0.2 - 0.32 used by Skolelinux versions.
  * Moved partition requests into separate .table files, and choose table
    based on debian-installer/profile content.  Add depend on
    profilechooser to make sure debconf contain the requested multiselect
    value.  If the value is empty or unknown, use default.table.
  * Split partitioning operation in two, one calculating the new partition
    layout, and another doing the change.  This will make it possible to
    preview the partitioning changes.
  * Add depend on di-fake to make sure libparted.so is available at run
    time.
  * Change orders of provides entries to get around a bug in anna.  This
    should get base-installer to depend on autopartkit.
  * Increase priority to standard to get anna to install this package by
    default.
  * Refuse to compile on platforms where the default partition table
    format is unknown.  At the moment this is all non-x86 platforms.
  * Add code to handle both v1.4 and v1.6 of libparted.  The code uses
    v1.6 API, but there is a compatibility wrapper in parted-compat.h
  * Source converted to use autoconf/automake.
  * Change log location to /var/log/messages.
  * Change menu entry and confirm question to make it more obvious that
    this is an unsafe program.
  * Make sure we ask the user if it is OK to destroy the partition tables
    before destroying the partition tables.
  * Add code to handle several different file system types.
  * Add SCSI-support.
  * Add some support for creating LVM partitions.
  * Change menu item value from 3 to 50 to match new numbering schema.
    The package both partitions and mounts, this its range is 40-60.
  * Make this package compile with both libparted 1.4 and 1.6.
  * Use libparted 1.6 by default.
  * Use 'ext3' by default when using libparted 1.6.
