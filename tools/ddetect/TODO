all
* only ethdetect has been modified to use debconf, the others are broken now until they are modified, if, indeed, that ever happens



ethdetect
* perhaps probe to see if the module can actually be loaded before bugging the user for any more information?
* set up anything that needs doing so the modules will be automatically loaded when we reboot
* probe the card to see if the modules is already loaded
* clean up the return values, decide what is really a failure, and how to handle it
* full detection not working in my chroot, not sure why, I turned it off for now
* if it's a PCI module, don't prompt them for parameters (does that work for all PCI modules?)
* libdetect should be made into a pic library
