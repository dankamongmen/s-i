pcmcia-udeb (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * ftp-master please note: I do know what I'm doing; this udeb intentionally
    has no files in it, aside from its postinst.

pcmcia-udeb (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * This package contains the more d-i specific parts (menu item, etc),
    and depends on pcmcia-cs-udeb, which will be provided by the pcmcia-cs
    package, and on pcmcia-modules, which is provided by the
    kernel-pcmcia-modules-* packages. At the moment it is very simplistic,
    and untested, but something like it has been observed to work, at least
    once..
