cdrom-detect (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

cdrom-detect (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copy prebaseconfig.d script from prebaseconfig.  Ejecting CDs belong
    here, not in prebaseconfig.
  * Remove discover/detect workaround.  Tollef Fog Heen told me it is
    no longer needed (Closes: #157735).

cdrom-detect (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Log the detected distribution.

    module should be loaded from floppy, and question letting the user
    know that a working CD was found.
  * Add myself to uploaders.

cdrom-detect (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    -  Move content of /etc/modules.conf to the rootskel udeb, and remove
       the file to avoid package conflict.
  * Tollef Fog Heen
    -  Remove rm of conffile in debian/rules, since it made the package not
       build.

cdrom-detect (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

    - Replace XBC with XB so our special control fields don't confuse the
      changes files.
  * André Luís Lopes
    - Update pt_BR.po template translation.

cdrom-detect (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * exit 0 if the cd is already mounted.
  * Set debconf answer mirror/distribution using info from the
    detected CD.
  * Convert to po-debconf, set Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper (>= 4.1.13)
    to ensure that generated templates are right, and set output encoding
    to UTF-8.
  * Drop depend on non-existant package discover-basic-udeb.
  * Correct floppy device, and try to load the floppy driver module
    before mounting floppies.
  * Make sure driver modules fetched from floppy are owned by root, to
    avoid rejections from depmod -a.
  * Use the same way as discover to find out if a module is available.
  * Avoid error message if /usr/share/discover is missing (Closes: #157735).

cdrom-detect (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix up using discover somewhat
  * Remove emacs changelog variables
  * Make _all udeb, not _$(ARCH)
  * Strip off the Package header in the templates file, since it could
    confuse cdebconf.
  * Get rid of the build-dep on cdebconf-dev, we don't build-dep on it at
    all.
  * Use discover's database instead of detect, build-dep accordingly.
  * Add Brazilian Portuguese and Danish debconf templates.
  * Make debian-boot maintainer with hertzog and tfheen in uploaders.

 -- Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Sep 2002 00:13:28 +0200

  * Fix up language on templates.
