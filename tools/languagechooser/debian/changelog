languagechooser (0.012) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed to use Architecture: all.
  * Corrected build-dep.  No need to depend on libcdebconf-dev any more.
  * Change menu item from 25 to 10.
  * Remove translated description from debian/control.  lintian
    complains, so this must be the wrong place for it.
  * Use language part from locale if language-name question fails.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Converted to use po-debconf.  A dependency against po-debconf >= 0.6.0
      is needed because language list choice has 2 leading underscores.
    - Language selection is performed by the debian-installer/language-name
      question, debian-installer/language only contains language code.
  * André Luís Lopes :
    - Add pt_BR template translation.
