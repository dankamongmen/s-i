  * Denis Barbier:
    - Add debian/po/output file to convert templates into UTF-8
    - Add backup capabilities to languagechooser
    - Managing country list seems not obvious, only countries which
      provide Debian mirrors are printed.  This criterion may change
      later.

      displayed with some country names.  The iso-codes package contains
      translations of many language and country names.

    complains, so this must be the wrong place for it.
  * Use language part from locale if language-name question fails.

    - Converted to use po-debconf.  A dependency against po-debconf >= 0.6.0
      is needed because language list choice has 2 leading underscores.
    - Language selection is performed by the debian-installer/language-name
      question, debian-installer/language only contains language code.
