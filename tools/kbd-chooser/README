Compile in support for various keyboards.

Note: its possible to have a variety of 'non-arch' keyboards, eg. it
is possible to put a Sun keyboard on a PC, using a serial
adaptor. This is why all keymaps are present in
'console-data'. However this is unlikely (and I don't think you can
boot off a serial keyboard), so they are likely not to be compiled in
on floppy versions (though maybe CD versions) of the installer.
