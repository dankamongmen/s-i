- Handle bootkkbd=xx case
  (ie set in /proc/cmdline )

-   Read default keymap for USB (bluetooth?) keyboards, sparc

- on netinst, all console-keymap-* packages are installed.
  Try installing only the ones that are required (eg don't pull in
  console-keymaps-sun on an i386 install)

- Only install console-keymaps-at on arm arch for the appropriate
  hardware.

- Add regression test to ensure data udebs are correct
	(For space, no error checking done in this code)

- Finish template & i18n code

- Include compose maps on a per-language basis , a la Mandrake.

- Ensure that kbd-chooser can run on an installed system, not just
  when initially installing.
  ( requires cdebconf to work correctly on an installed system)
