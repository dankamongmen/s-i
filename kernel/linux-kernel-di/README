This package generates kernel modules udebs for the debian installer. It
build-depends on the kernel image, and pulls modules out of it to create
the udebs. It also generates one package with only the kernel in it.

The modules to put in each udeb are listed in the files in the modules
directory. The files contain paths relative to the top-level kernel modules
directory (/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/). In fact these files are used as
the input to a tar command, and can list either files, or whole
directories, though the latter is rarely used.

The copy-modules script does the actual copying of modules to the temp dirs
that are used to build the package. It is complicated by the need to make
sure that all of a module's dependencies are included in its package, or in
a package on which it depends. If necessary, extra modules will be added to
a package to make sure the dependencies are satisfied.

The dependency information in the modules is compared with the module-deps
file, which lists interrelationships between packages, in a form used by
tsort. As such, it must be kept sorted. The same dependency information is
redundantly included in debian/control too, and these two need to be kept
in sync.

The modules packages are named with the version of the kernel in their
package name, since that can be useful during kernel transitions. The -di
prefix is used to prevent any posible collisions in names with real debs.
