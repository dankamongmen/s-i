  * Use cdebconf's new column alignment feature; requires: cdebconf (0.129).
  * Drop dependency on ancient version of di-utils.
  * Testing for $TERM_FRAMEBUFFER is more reliable than testing the debconf
    parameter as there are more factors that determine whether we have a
    framebuffer or not. Requires rootskel (>= 1.61).
  * When not in UTF-8 mode, make sure that for the language list the Choices
    values are displayed and not the Choices-C values.

  * Remove duplication of Icelandic in languagelist.l10n.
  * Make it possible to back up to earlier dialogs by bringing the main
    localechooser code under a state engine.
  * Display a message when changing the language is no longer possible because
    translations have been deleted. Left disabled for now because of #470258.
  * Merge languagelist.l10n into languagelist.
  * Identify languages by language code instead of language name. This
    improves support for languages with variants in different countries.
  * Remove redundant check for serial console: variables have already been set
    when the installer was initialized.
  * Build the list of languages for the current display level at runtime
    instead of having separate templates for them. This does make starting
    localechooser slightly slower, but saves memory. Closes: #365307.
  * Ensure we always set debconf/language and call gtk-set-font at the same
    time. Thanks to Jérémy Bobbio for his help tracing this. Closes: #470481.
  * Patch by Matthias Klose stolen from Ubuntu (closes: #468635):
