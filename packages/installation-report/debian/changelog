  * Remove discover1 call, discover isn't really used during installs much
    anyway anymore, and we have lspci. Closes: #367031
  * Try to run pccardctl as well as cardctl for current 2.6 kernels, but run
    both instead of trying to detect which to use. Closes: #367032
  * Add an echo before asking for root password.
  * Change the checklist a bit in the template, to add something about
    tasksel, time zone setup, user setup.
  * Prebaseconfig transition.

installation-report (2.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Due to scheduling/fjp-sanity issues, d-i beta2 is going to be releasing
    with version 2.12 of save-logs, so log file permissions will be wrong. At
    some point (soon) a later version of installation-report will reach
    testing and on upgrade fix installs made before that point, but then
    installs made afterwards will not run installation-report's postinst at
    the right time to receive the fix. Work around this problem by installing
    an init script that fixes the log file permissions on boot. Note that
    this init script is scheduled for removal once beta2 is obsolete.

    - Remove dead (since r12587) copy_cdebconf_db code.
  * Joey Hess
    - Stop using package-versions in postinst too (just copy status file),
      and remove the script.
    - Remove some hardcoded /bin paths.
    - Depend on the new mountfloppy udeb, and use the mountfloppy command
      to get the floppy mounted. This means it can prompt for a floppy device
      if it doesn't find the floppy, and so there is usb floppy support,
      assuming the usb mass storage modules have been loaded by hw-detect
      or the boot floppy. Closes: #220306, #221575
    - Remove udeb extended description.
    - Minor indentation cleanups.
    - Reword the message if floppy mount fails.
    - Add "httpd", a very simple http server, and add a menu that can be used
      to start it.
    - Add support for saving debug logs to a mounted filesystem. If /hd-media
      is already mounted, offer it as the default to support USB keys,
      otherwise the user must mount the filesystem by hand. Closes: #267219
    - Use an error template for failed floppy mount.
    - Take down the progress bar if saving a log failed.
    - Save log files to an "install" subdir of the floppy or filesystem;
      if "install" exists go on to "install.2", etc.
    - Cut down on the hardcoded paths to commands.
    - Remove the hdparm stuff that has never really worked, and that 
      is dependent on kernels compiled with devfs.
    - Make report-hw work on regular Debian as well as on d-i, various
      improvements.
    - Add cardctl ident and status to report-hw.
    - Include /proc/bus/usb/devices in report-hw.
    - Add uname -a and free output to report-hw.
    - Add installation-report package, rename bugreporter-udeb to save-logs
      (more accurate), and rename source package to installation-logs.
    - installation-report package has reportbug integration to semi-automate
      a user filing an installation report.
    - Add a man page for report-hw.
    - Add myself to uploaders.
    - Most of the log saving code moved to here from prebaseconfig,
      and the logs moved to /var/log/installer.
    - Reworded and reorganised the installation report template, to
      better prompt the user for info we need. Move hardware info to end,
      and prompt for a log file.
    - Depend on prebaseconfig 1.08.
    - Add /proc/bus/input/devices to report-hw output.
    - If /etc/lsb-release exists in the installer, include it in the log
      files.

    - Speed up the package-versions script by using more grep instead of
      the slow read.  This addresses #248037, but I'm leaving the bug
      open in case someone comes up with an even quicker (but maybe
      incompatible) solution.

    - Drop the use of tar; it cannot work because bb tar does not support
      creation, and /target is not available most of the time when you want to
      report a bug. Just copy files to the floppy.
    - Unmount the floppy on start, for idempotency and in case it was left
      mounted by some buggy code.
    - Shorten the menu item.
    - Include partman log, if available.
