Default: false
_Description: Really use the automatic partitioning tool?
 This will destroy the partition table on all disks in the machine.
 REPEAT: THIS WILL WIPE CLEAN ALL HARD DISKS IN THE MACHINE!
 If you have important data that are not backed up, you may want to
 stop now in order to do a backup. In that case, you'll have to
 restart the installation later.

Template: autopartkit/refuse
Type: note
_Description: Automatic partitioning impossible
 This version of the autopartitioner cannot handle the
 partitioning of the selected disk. It may partition only an empty disk or
 a disk with no more than 2 FAT partitions (and no extended partitions or
 other non-FAT partitions).
 .
 If you want to continue the installation process, switch to the second
 console (ALT+F2), partition the disk as you like using parted and the
 other available tools, and then mount all your partitions in /target.
 /target is the root directory of your new system, so your root partition
 will be mounted on /target and your /usr partition must be mounted on
 /target/usr.
 .
 You can also consider launching this program again but selecting another
 disk.

Template: autopartkit/notenoughspace
Type: error
_Description: Not enough space on disk
 The autopartitioner makes some assumptions about partition sizes, and
 because of that it requires at least 3GB of free space. The free space
 on this disk appears to be below this limit.
 .
 If you really want to install, you'll have to free some space.
 You may also launch this program again and select another disk with
 more free space.
