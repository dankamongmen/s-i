      bump and security fixes.
    - Remove atkd and i8042 from input-modules as they're now linked in

linux-kernel-di-ia64-2.6 (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add atkd and i8042 to input-modules to support ps2 keyboards.
    - Built against version 2.6.8-9 of the kernel-image.
    - Gratuitous version number bump.
    - Follow the lead of the i386 package in temporarily putting crc-ccitt
      in the kernel-image package since it's needed by two modules in
      different udebs now and there's no other more appropriate package and
      this is a bad time to split out out.
