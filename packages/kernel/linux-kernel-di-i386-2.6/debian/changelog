linux-kernel-di-i386-2.6 (0.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move eth1394 to the nic-modules from firewire-core-modules, so we can
    avoid putting it on initrds that lack other nic drivers, which caused
    the firewire interface to be brought up too early and in the wrong order.
    nic-modules now depends on firewire-core-modules. This is a quick fix,
    so it wasn't changed in kernel-wedge. Closes: #260600

  * Alastair McKinstry
    - Add ufs-modules, needed for *BSD detection in os-probe.
  * Joey Hess
    - Update to the 2.6.7 kernel.
    - Built with new kernel-wedge to add sata module.
    - tg3 is back
    - added some new modules: dpt_i2o, ipr, qlogicfas408, de600,
      de620, defxx, s2io
    - sis190 is gone, mark it optional
    - hid is renamed to usbhid
    - firmware_class is needed by both tg3 and ipr, so both nic-modules and

      and added dependencies.
    - Build-Depend on kernel-wedge 1.18 for firmware-modules support.
