installation-locale (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on locales 2.5, so that we get a version that works with
    glibc 2.5. Probably needs glibc 2.5.

installation-locale (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Denis Barbier ]
  * Save about 35kB in the udeb by dropping definitions for

installation-locale (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split off from rootskel.
