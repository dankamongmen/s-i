This package is, frankly, a collection of hacks, hung on a reasonable
framework to which you can add more hacks to save memory. The memory saving
hacks are divided into two groups, which run at different times:
initialisation, and post anna run.

Initialisation hacks are in the debian-installer.d/S10lowmem scripts, in
the lowmemcheck package. The is what decides if the system is low on
memory, and it creates /var/lib/lowmem as a flag indicating the system
should be in lowmem mode. Other hacks test for this file.

Post anna run hacks are in the lowmem package, which is queued for install
by anna on lowmem systems, and provides a menu item.

Current hacks:

	disable framebuffer
		Running w/o framebuffer saves lots of memory. The unifont.bgf
		is also removed, saving much ram.

	remove translations, force English
		Happens at both init, and also trimtemplates is called by
		udpkg when unpacking packages.

		Saves a significant, but not huge amount of memory.

	truncate log files
		Happens after anna run. By now the log files may be rather
		large, and so this truncates them and restarts the tails.

		Saves a few hundred K of memory, at the expense of
		diagnostics.

	remove debconf templates after load
		This is done at initialisation by rootskel. After
		initialisation, udpkg takes care of it. It's not in lowmem,
		because this is a safe, simple trick that's worth doing on
		even systems with lots of memory.

		Saves a few hundred K of memory.

Possible future hacks:

	remove loaded kernel modules
		If a kernel module is loaded, there is no reason to keep it
		on the ramdisk.
	
		May free hundreds of KB of memory.

	remove all kernel modules
		If lowmem runs after hw-detect-full, we probably don't need
		any of the kernel modules in the initrd (except filesystem
		modules, hmm..)
	
		Removing them would free up tons of space. Fairly 
		unsafe/inflexible though.
	
	remove all keymaps
		After keyboard is selected, not needed.
	
	find swap partitions and auto-swapon
		Try to scan disks for existing swap partitions and swapon.
		This will make later partitioning a bit more difficult, and
		requires a previous install.
	
	let user choose a partition to use as swap
		Scan disks for existing small-ish partitions, list them,
		and offer to turn them into swap space.
	
	prioritise udebs, and only load important ones
		Currently all standard priority udebs are loaded. If the
		udebs are re-preioritised so those that are absolutely
		needed for an install are important, then anna could
		install only that smaller set. anna could also in this mode
		prompt at a higher priority for what udebs to load.
	
		This could get us down to 28 or 24 mb, probably.
