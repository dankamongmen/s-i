lowmem (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Before running the "kill" command, check whether there is actually
      any suitable "tail" process to kill; otherwise the postinst will
      fail when there is no such process which is always the case in
      serial console installs and might be the case when the postinst
      is run twice.  Closes: #260949
    - Also, be super cautious and use kill $pid || true because there
      is the possibilty for a race occuring; thanks, Joey Hess.
    - Increase needed ram on mipsel from 25 to 33: installations on
      Cobalt machines without lowmem do not work with 32 MB but work
      with 36 MB, so enable lowmem when less than 36 MB are found.
      (Machines with 35 MB RAM are shown to have 32, 32 MB are shown
      as 29, so pick 33 for needed ram.)

lowmem (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the stuff in S31lowmem to S10lowmem, so it runs before the code that
    decides whether to enable framebuffer. I think this code moved during
    recent rootskel changes.
