  * Fix error in French translation. Closes: #400715.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Make wget respect proxy servers defined for local sources. Based on a
    patch suggested by John Morrissey, for which thanks. Closes: #408297.
  * Use log-output for commands that produce output if run in the installer.
  * Consistently use http protocol when setting up security archive (ftp
    reguires a different mirror directory and is thus not easy to support).
  * Reduce timeout for testing security mirrors to 30 seconds. As security.d.o
    currently has 3 IP addresses listed, and these are tried consecutively, the
    total timeout will be 1.5 minutes (was 6 minutes). Closes: #393033.
  * apt-setup-verify: reset IFS to avoid problems with option processing.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
