apt-setup (1:0.36) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Don't scan the installation CD if it does not include base packages.
  * Because of reported issues with accessing the CD in the /target environment
    if it is already mounted in the D-I environment, base-installer has been
    reverted to loop-mounting the installation CD. In order to still allow
    CD-changing while avoiding these issues and keeping installs idempotent, we
    now need to allow apt-cdrom to manage mounting/unmounting for all types of
    CD images (except for hd-media installs). See: #474346, #475639.
    Requires: base-installer (>= 1.90), pkgsel (>= 0.19), di-utils (>= 1.57).

  * Put apt downloading info in the progress bar.
  * Allocate 100 steps on the progress bar for each generator,
    and 100 steps for verifying each generated block.
  * Export PROGRESS_FROM and PROGRESS_TO to generators, giving the
    starting and ending progress bar position for that generator. This can
    be used by generators that need an absolute progress bar position for
    calling debconf-apt-progress.
  * apt-setup-verify: Use debconf-apt-progress and add a way for generators
    to specify how it should advance the progress bar.
  * Allow the progress bar to be canceled.
  * 50mirror: Call choose-mirror -n to avoid trashing the progress bar.

  * debian/rules: move packaging rules from binary-arch to binary-indep.
  * Adjust templates for mirror use to also cover installation from CD sets.
  * Only ask to use a mirror at low priority if more that 8 CDs or 2 DVDs were
    scanned.
  * Language tasks fit on CD3/DVD1; don't warn about missing packages from
    them unless necessary.
  * Move templates for mirror use linked to installation from CD to apt-cdrom
    as they can only be used when that is installed.
  * Disable option to cancel progress bar as there are issues with it.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Add support for CD/DVD sets during installation:
    - rename generator 50cdrom to 40cdrom to make room for new generator
    - add new generator 41cdset to support scanning additional CD/DVDs
    - add script load-install-cd
    To support CD/DVD changing, the installation CD/DVD needs to be unmounted
    in the D-I environment during package installation, which means that e.g.
    running anna-install to install udebs is no longer possible. Because of
    this components/scripts also need make sure that the installation CD is
    loaded and mounted again after package installation.
    Components/scripts that can install packages in /target after apt-setup
    has been run should either use apt-install, or create the correct
    conditions themselves (as pkgsel does).
    Requires apt (0.7.9) in testing for #448187 and #448521, and requires
    pkgsel (1.16) and di-utils (1.50).
  * Add myself as uploader.

apt-setup (1:0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
