user-setup (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Add the first created user to useful groups (code coming
    from base-config)
  * log all calls to adduser

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix setpassword: perl is already run in the chroot, so there's no need
    to try to chroot again.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add po/output file to ensure utf-8 encoding.
