user-setup (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Detect and error out on reserved usernames, i.e. those that are already
    used by some parts of the system. Unfortunately there's no particularly
    straightforward way to identify a reserved username, and the only way I
    can think of is to maintain a blacklist; so I've collated this from the
    base-passwd master files and those user and group names I found on some
    of my systems. Feel free to extend this as the need arises.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Spell "username" consistently.

  * Add first user to two additional groups: netdev and powerdev
    Note that this assumes that something creates these groups during
    the task installation, as hal does with powerdev. The first user is added
    to the groups in finish-install so the groups need not be static.
