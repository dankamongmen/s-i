pkgsel (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Propagate debian-installer/keymap from cdebconf to /target, used by
    xserver-xorg to infer the X keymap.
  * Use loops for diversion handling so that the list is kept in just one
    place.
  * Stop removing popularity-contest for now until the cdebconf PURGE crash
    is fixed.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Consolidate debconf-copydbs into one command.
  * Pass -q to a few apt-get commands, to avoid gratuotous logging of download
    progress (the main cause of this will be fixed in tasksel though).
  * Propigate out nonzero exit codes from tasksel to main-menu so that it can
    signal a back up.

pkgsel (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Set LANG to C in postinst so that the bare chroot calls don't trigger
    perl warning messages for C.UTF-8 locale. (See #344159)
  * Note that this does not affect the LANG set for the main package
    installation run, which will be handled by in-target.
  * Fix progress bar title.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix di-utils build-dependency, and bump required version to 1.20 for
    in-target.
  * Capitalise db_progress subcommand names.
  * Remove trailing spaces from pkgsel.templates, which confused cdebconf.
  * Change section to debian-installer (fixes lintian warning).

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Propagate three debconf variables from cdebconf to /target:
    debian-installer/language, debian-installer/country

    passwd/username
      Used by exim4-config to determine where to send root mail.
