* Put up the progress bar on startup, at least before retreiving the
  Packages file.

* Release files

* Better error-resistance. One failing package shouldn't shoot everything.
  (Partly done now that we have retriever error correction.)

* "Tasks". Only list udebs that have a certain control field. Use the contents
  of that control field as info in the list. Other udebs will be pulled in by
  dependencies.

* Break out the retreiver selection prompt and all the associated code into 
  the load-installer program, there is no reason to keep it in anna, and
  it's just wasting space on the root floppy.

* Get rid of the ugly and fragile hack that parses package names to try to
  detect kernel module udebs and only install ones for the current kernel,
  and replace it with proper dependency checking. Throw out udebs whose
  deps cannot be met.

* Include all packages that will be autoinstalled in the question about
  what to install, in addition to those that will not be installed.
  In corner cases the user may need to omit a particular package
  from being installed even though it would be normally (think kernel
  module udeb with a module that hangs with the given HW or something).
