"Select a partition to remove it or to specify how Debian is going to use "
"it.  At a bare minimum, Debian needs one partition to contain the root of "
"the file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a "
"separate swap partition is a necessity.  \"Swap\" is scratch space for an "
"operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as \"virtual "
"memory\"."
