    - Use substvars to get a usual libc6 dependency, libc6-udeb's provide will
      work with this since libd-i does not do version checking. libc-udeb,
      which was depended on, is no longer in unstable.

    - Split arm into sub-architectures: use msdos for netwinder, bast and
      riscstation.  Other sub-arches are not supported at the moment (most
      of them require acorn labels).
    - Make partman the default on arm.  Those sub-arches not supported by
      parted are currently not supported by debian-installer anyway.
      Those which are supported use msdos labels.

    - the description of the template of the main menu is clearer and is
      visible at startup.  Also partman-target provides a help item in
      the main menu.  Thanks to Martin Michlmayr (closes: #238381).  
    - two dividers -- before and below the partition table.
    - in the confirmation dialog say which partitions are going to be
      formatted.  Thanks to Sven Luther, Mario Girlando and Frans Pop 
      (closes: #237009, #238389, #239388).
    - templates: make partman/confirm_write_new_label translatable
    - parted_server.c: do not generate exceptions when creation of file
      system fails. 
    - definitions.sh: write separator in the log file.  This keeps track
      in the log file which scripts are being executed. 
    - definitions.sh (debconf_select): convert the first space in the
      options to non-break space as otherwise the default options is
      ignored if it starts with space.
    - visual.d/method: show the smileys for all methods, not only for keep
      and format. 
    - add a new script update.d/default_visuals
    - visual.d/{filesystem,mountpoint} use visual_{filesystem,mountpoint}
    - definitions.sh (valid_human): allow strings ending with spaces
    - parted_server.c: new function named_partition_is_virtual
    - parted_server.c (command_get_file_system): report file system only
      when the partition is not virtual.  Thanks to Martin Michlmayr,
      closes: #238386
    - parted_server.c (command_resize_partition): do not commit the new
      partition table if the partition was virtual, do not resize the file
      system in virtual partitions
    - parted_server.c (command_resize_partition): return the right value
      of the end of the new partition geometry
    - parted_server.c (get_resize_range): do not take into account the
      file system in virtual partitions
    - add dependency on di-utils-mapdevfs
    - definitions.sh (human2longint): when no multiplier is given the
      default is megabytes.  Thanks to dan_at_watson.ibm.com, closes: #239561
    - rules: remove .svn directories from the package
    - show which partition we are editing in the active_partition
      menu. Thanks to Gaby Schilders, bilbrey_at_orbdesigns.com and
      Matthew Woodcraft, closes: #238712, #239430, #239445.
    - definitions.sh (menudir_default_choice): do not run the choice
      scripts in order to find the item-id.  Take the id as argument
      instead
    - parted_server.c (partition_info): parted returns wrong paths of the
      devices of the partitions in dvh (SGI) disk labels.  Correct them.
      Thanks to Thiemo Seufer, Nicholas Breen and Maitland Bottoms, 
      closes: #220990, #238363, #239648.
    - do not provide partitioned-harddrives on mips (parted recognises but
      can not edit properly dvh disk labels
    - change the main-menu number of partman on mips from 49 to 44: use
      partitioner to partition harddrives but partman instead of partconf
    - definitions.sh (partition_tree_choices): shorten the indent of the
      partitions; visual.d/name: change the width of the name from 14->12.
      These changes are because dvh disk labels have both primary/logical
      partitions and partition names so the space is not enough for the
      mount point.
    - parted_server.c: fix segmentation fault when resizing partition with
      no file system
    - do not remove /var/lib/partman at startup, make directories with
      predictable names in $DEVICES.  Thanks to Brad Schick, closes: #240145

    - creation of new label should ignore the non-zero codes returned by
      storage_device/label/do_option. 
    - visual.d/filesystem: show the unusable free spaces as "unusable"
      instead of "FREE SPACE".  Most of the partition table types do not
      have extended and logical partitions and there was no indication in
      the main menu when some free space is unusable.
    - move the confirmation dialog for the creation of new label from here
      to partman-partitioning.
    - for s390, make partman not to be default partitioner, as it does not
      handle ibm disk labels.
    - for m68k, do the same since partman is quiet slow here and doesn't
      support the atari subarch.
    - new binary stralign to work around the broken support of wide
      characters in printf.

    - I observed that the type of the partition is not translatable.  So I
      added four new templates - "primary", "logical", "pri/log" and
      "unusable".  Sorry, translators - without the new templates
      these strings would be left untranslated anyway.
    - a necessary change for SPARCs.  Because of bug/limitation in the
      implementation of the Sun disk labels in libparted they must be
      written to the disk before any consequent edition.  Because of that
      a new template had to be added (it is going to be used only on SPARCs). 
    - these changes are still not used by the other code of partman.
  * Joey Hess
    - Parameterise the menu-item-number.
    - For arm, make partman not be the default partitioner, as it does not
      handle 4 partitioning schemes used by arm subarches.
    - For mips, do the same, since parted does not know about dvh
      partitioning. Also because it's kinda slow (15 minutes on a fast indy).
    - Minor polishing of the new template.

    - templates: add partman/progress/init/update_partitions.
    - definitiions.sh, parted_server.c: use third fifo file (stopfifo) in
      order not to rely on suppositions how libc works during
      synchronisation.
    - new file: init.d/dump.  It saves complete information about the
      partition tables in the log file of partman
    - don't show the menu storage_device.  Instead show a boolean question
      asking the users if they want to create a new, empty partition table
      on the selected disk.  Closes: #235365.
  * Joey Hess
    - Changed the menu item text again, removing the "(partman)".
    - Unfuzzy all translations.
    - Make ask_user use a default_choice file (insteas of last_choice).
    - Add a menudir_default_choice function which sets the default_choice of a
      menudir to the output of the given menu items's choices script.
    - Make debconf_select only set the default if a default is passed into
      it, to allow for database preseeding.
    - Stop using non-breaking spaces, using new space escape code in
      recent cdebconf. Fixes display on non-framebuffer terminal.
      (Anton Zinoviev: I reenabled non-breaking spaces as I can not use
      escaped spaces.  Properly setup non-framebuffer terminal must be
      able to display non-break spaces.)
    - Enhance confirm_new_label template text.

    - new release
  * Joey Hess

      not accidentially destroy his data
    - shorten title to work around cdebconf bug

partman (11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - in the menu for a storage device added new item to cancel the menu
      (for debconf frontends without back button)
    - sort the storage devices so that for example the devices on the
      second IDE channel are not listed before the devices on the first
      IDE channel
    - in the main menu: swap finish and undo.  Changed the text of finish
      and abort
    - renumbered init.d/update_partitions (90->70),
      init.d/filesystems_detected (91->71) and active_partition/finish
      (99->75) 
    - deactivated active_partition/chs (put "exit 0" in choices script)
    - fixed bug in update.d/visual causing only the first word of the
      partition name to be shown in the main menu
    - visual.d/filesystem uses template partman/filesystem_short/... as
      said in the new version of the documentation.
    - definitions.sh (error_handler): added support for new undocumented
      exception type 'No Implementation'
    - definitions.sh (error_handler): use partman/exception_handler_note
      instead of partman/exception_handler when there is only one one
      alternative
    - parted_server.c (command_get_resize_range): add
      deactivate_exception_handler
    - parted_server.c (resize_partition): add check for the case when
      there is a file system but it can not be opened
    - debian/templates: state that `partition the storage devices' is an
      alternative partitioner rather than additional partitioning step in
      the installer process

partman (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - Partman doesn't rely any more on partconf-mkfstab to convert devfs
      devices to normal devices.  A new command map_devfs does this using
      directly libdebian-installer.  
    - Add dependency on libdebian-installer4-udeb and build-dependency on
      libdebian-installer4-dev.
    - Use 32 instead of 40 as number for update-dev in commit.d to make
      the room between update-dev and the next script larger.
    - Use 20 instead of 90 as number for remove_backup in commit.d.
      Otherwise `undo' can restore invalid partition scheme.
    - Removed probably unnecessary loop in the abort function of /bin/partman.

    - Because of a bug in po-debconf, generated templates file is
      corrupted if a comment appears before the Template line, as
      before the partman/active_partition template.  Closes: #232489
