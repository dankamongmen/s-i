partman-efi (10) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Build on i386, for i386-based Apple systems; restrict to systems with
    EFI (i.e. /proc/efi or /sys/firmware/efi exist).
  * Try to load efivars module on init to make sure that the kernel has a
    chance to create /proc/efi if appropriate.

  * Jim Lieb
    - Initial release
    - use partman-palo as template and create same for EFI boot partitions
      that are found on ia64 systems and x86 systems with EFI BIOS
    - Translations are a simple global substitute i.e. s/palo/efi/g

    - Uploading with high urgency as not having this package will result
      in users reaching the end of an install w/o having created an EFI
      partitioning, which will cause the boot loader install to fail.
