    - automatically_partition/some_device/do_option: creates new partition
      table with the default for the architecture type.  Closes: #235923
    - perform_recipe: start progress bar, as autopartitioning can be quiet
      slow
  * Joey Hess
    - add xfs and reiserfs to the valid fs list (should this use info from the
      plugins?)
    - if there is no valid recipe, bail with an error instead of hanging.

    - Use a different question for the initial autopartitioning.
    - After autopartitioning, set the default menu item on choose_partitions
      to the one that finishes the install. Closes: #235900
  * Anton Zinoviev
    - new files: perform_recipe and recipes.sh

      recipes.sh
    - perform_recipe: remove all old method files.  Closes: #235194.
    - recipes.sh: new function choose_recipe
    - automatically_partition/some_device/do_option: use directly

      Closes: #235377.
    - Scripts that include recipes.sh  include also definition.sh,
      recipes.sh doesn't include definitions.sh any more.
