    - Remove redundant "the new Debian GNU/Linux system". Saying "The new
      system is now ready to boot" is sufficient, and branding-friendlier.
    - Throw an error if resolving the /initrd.img or /boot/initrd.img
      symlink fails, now that we're out of string freeze.
    - Use more serial-console-friendly text from partconf to refer the user
      to the third console or /var/log/messages.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add missing depends on archdetect.
    - Switch from using archdetect debconf template to calling archdetect
