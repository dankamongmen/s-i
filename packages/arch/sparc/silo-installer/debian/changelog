silo-installer (1.00) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Yeesh. Build the package in binary-arch, not binary-indep.
    - [ -n "$bootfs" ] instead of [ "$bootfs" ].
    - Remove isinstallable and take care of apt-installing silo in
      the postinst, since debootstrap no longer takes care of this.
      (Closes: #262188)
    - Install initrd stanzas for vmlinuz and vmlinuz.old. (closes: #283062)

silo-installer (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Convert to new debhelper udeb support.
    - Fix more thinkos involving ${bootpart}.
  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Remove Moshe Zadka as uploader.
    - Stop using df to find the /target partition (failed on 100 gb drives
      due to field width issues), and make the file system type be found in
      a way that is less prey to false positives.
  * Colin Watson
    - Fix 'findfs /' (mount outputs "on /target", not "on /target/").
    - 'findfs /boot' now returns the empty string if /boot is on the root
      partition. Cope with this.

    - Merge the completely different silo-installer 0.0.1 that is in

    - Add success message for when DEBCONF_PRIORITY is medium.
    - If /boot is mounted separately, do not tell silo to use /boot/vmlinuz
      but to use /vmlinuz (because it is all relative to /boot.)
