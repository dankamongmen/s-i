    - Add support to installing with root on software raid, although it
      assumes that putting root=/dev/md0 in lilo.conf will cause lilo to
      properly install to all disks in the array, which I'm told may not work
      for all raid types. This is still so broken that it's not fair to claim
      that it closes bug 265900.
