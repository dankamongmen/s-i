This little program allows the user to pick a http (could support ftp too)
mirror, by choosing first a country, then a mirror, or by manually entering
mirror info. The mirror list is built into it at compile time.

After it has run, the debconf question http/hostname will have the mirror 
host, http/directory will have the base of the mirror, and http/proxy may
contain proxy info in standard form. These values can be used by
retrievers, and eventually, I'd hope, by apt-setup.
