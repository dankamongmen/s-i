# Given a partial templates file on stdin which can contain some

# Most countries have only one time zone, and for these no template is
# generated, but a mapping file is created mapping a country to its time
# zone.

# Countries that have more than one time zone should ideally be included
# in the input file, since generating a usable list of time zones for a
# country is difficult, and it doesn't try very hard to make it
