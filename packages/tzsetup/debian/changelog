tzsetup (3.00) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Split off from base-config.
  * Only generate udeb (for now).
  * Remove GMT setting support, goes to a new udeb.
  * Removed confirmation questions and command line flags.
  * Renamed templates all around for consistency.
  * Ripped out all the nasty complexity of the state machine, now asks only
    one simple question.
  * Ripped out preseed_zone thing as there is only one question that needs
    preseding in all cases now: time/zone.
  * Generate templates containing lists of time zones for countries at build
    time, with overrides for specific countries in the .in file.
  * Add a prebaseconfig hook script to set the time zone in /target.

  * Patch from Colin to remove unnecesary Debian "branding", including
    parameterisation of the security.debian.org host. Closes: #311870
  * Patch from Bubulle to clarify the error message about invalid hostnames.
    Closes: #264615
  * Remove (undocumented) tzsetup -U parameter. Now tzsetup will always
    pay attention to the UTC setting in rcS, unless it is a new install,
    when it will instead pay attention to preseeding.
  * tzsetup will always source rcS (even on a new install), so the code to
    change rcS does not misfire if no change was made.
  * tzsetup.1: Remove fairly pointless "Debian GNU/Linux".
  * Remove tzsetup question for Brazil on upgrade.

  * Finally applied Eugeniy Meshcheryakov's patch to remove charset setting,
    locale setting, etc from termwrap. All that stuff is done by other parts
    of d-i (and if it's not done properly will need to be fixed there).
    Termwrap remains only to support languages needing jfbterm and the like.
    Closes: #250789, #258226, #259150 (termwrap no longer breaks charset setup
    on exit)
    Closes: #271145, #271147 (cyr run removed so it no longer borks serial
    consoles)
  * Remove hardcoded paths in termwrap and base-config.
  * Other minor cleanups in termwrap.
  * No longer (re)set LANG at end of install. This is done by localechooser
    already. Closes: #251206, #259870

    after an install re-running apt-setup does not force whatever value was
    used by the install onto the user, which is especially important if they
    installed testing, which is now stable. Closes: #154482

    - Fix substitution variable in nb debconf translation. (#308183)
    - Removed the much hated apt-get clean run (and KEEP_DEBS),
      the benefit for very low disk space users is not worth the pain for the
      rest of us. Closes: #224403
    - Stop passing tasksel -ris parameters, since it no longer accepts them
      and handles standard installs on its own. Conflict with old tasksels.

    - Try to load a VGA framebuffer on amd64 as well as i386.
    - Support Archive-architecture: in Mirrors.masterlist. Architectures are
      space-separated, e.g. "i386 amd64"; lines of the form "!hurd-i386
      !netbsd-i386" are supported to say that the archive has all but the
      listed architectures, although that should be used with caution.
    - Export BC_TMPDIR so that hook scripts can use it.
    - Look for xserver-xorg as well as xserver-xfree86 when checking whether
      X has been installed.
    - Provide for simpler timezone preseeding by means of a new
      tzconfig/preseed_zone question.
    - Save a couple of sed calls in prep-menu.
    - scrollkeeper-update can take a long time to run, and when it's called
      many times by lots of postinst scripts it takes even longer due to
      parsing OMF directories over and over again. Divert it before
      installing packages, and undivert and run it afterwards.
    - apt-setup: Ask a friendlier question the first time round (without the
      prompt for a device file) if there's no CD in the drive.
    - Get d-i log files from /var/log/installer, if available, instead of
      /var/log/debian-installer (#304402).
    - Make apt-get and apt-cdrom use gpgv --ignore-time-conflict to avoid
      validation errors with apt 0.6 due to clock problems (Ubuntu bug
      #8496).
    - Allow derived distributions to set an alternate location for
      Mirrors.masterlist in debian/rules and to disable the CVS get
      altogether.
    - Support wildcard-DNS-style entries in Mirrors.masterlist, that get
      expanded out to one entry for every country code in iso3166.tab.

      zones. Similar templates can be added for other countries at need.
    - Also added hand-written template for Brazil.
    - Add debian-installer/language to the db, so things like
      dictionaries-common can use it.
    - Export TMPDIR.
    - Add dep on gettext-base.
    - mirror/distribution has been renamed to mirror/suite in d-i, follow
      .. er .. suite.
    - To prevent breaking beta2 too badly, set the default suite to
      testing. Unstable d-i will always override this, so it's safe to do.
    - Urgency set to high; this needs to get into testing to be tested..

  * Tommi Vainikainen
    - Add Finnish translation (fi.po).
  * Ilgiz Kalmetev
    - Update Russian templates tranlsation. Closes: #221445
  * Sent a few things to /dev/null.
  * Rename apt-setup/distribution to mirror/distribution, and
    apt-setup/http_proxy to mirror/http/proxy, to match values from
    debian-installer.
    Note that I still use symbolic release names in mirror/distribution,
    in contrast to d-i. I will accept code names though.
  * Add debian-installer/keymap dummy template to get values copied from d-i.
  * Inherit debconf/priority from d-i. This means it defaults to high for
    most installs, which is a large change!
  * Add support for copying configs in from a d-i cdebconf db, and for
    setting LANG based on debian-installer/locale. When present, a cdebconf
    db overrides dbootstrap_settings, but the old file is still supported,
    for now, for compatability.
  * Applied patch from Christian Perrier for debconf template polishing.
    Closes: #220836
    (However, there were some rejects, and so it was a hand merge, and
    the French translaton update part of the patch was droppd.)
  * Remove "persistent" from apt-setup/security-updates, added incorrectly
    by above patch.
  * No longer take the mere presense of /root/dbootstrap_settings as an
    indication of a new install; $1 must equal new.
  * Move and rename scripts that can be menu items, and add .mnu files to
    control their order and usage.
  * Add menu items to debconf templates.
  * Change hostname script to always prompt for the hostname at at least
    medium priority, but use high if the hostname is not set at all.
    This is so it will do something if picked manually from the menu.
  * Also, if the hostname is "localhost", as set by d-i on a non-networked
    (or dhcp?) install, always ask about it at high priority.
  * Fix hostname script to not do the stupid substitute into a default thing;
    the SET command is there for a reason.
  * Don't bother asking about or doing a poff.
  * Add a menu item to run a shell.
  * Merge the X hack and popcon into the pkgsel and apt-get steps.
  * Move the note about base-config from the intro to the final message.
  * Merge screen blanking code into intro and finish.
  * Merge all the final stuff into one finish menu item, which has better
    flow than we had before, with the final message really being final.
  * Enable xdm starter.
  * Remove redundant LANG setting code from base-config program, it will 
    only be handled by termwrap now.
  * Modify base-config to display a menu at medium priority, and operate
    based on .mnu files. If something goes wrong, drop debconf priority to a
    level that displays the menu, from which you can retry steps to hopefully
    correct it. Closes: #55403, #127678, #197073, #159544
  * Update base-config man page to document new stuff.
  * Only pass --unseen-only to dpkg-reconfigure calls when it's a new
    install. If base-config is re-run, old questions should also be
    shown.
  * Make pkgsel set a default package selector.
  * Improve localised strings for package selectors.
  * Cleaned up title setting.
  * Depend on debconf 1.3.22 for SETTITLE support and debconf-communicate.
  * Convert the install-problem template to a note, and always display the
    main menu if it fails there.
  * Increase the priority of the package selector question to high.
    Without displaying that question, I'd need a high priority note to explain
    what comes next anyway.
  * Remove text in hostname question about it being a fqdn. d-i puts a non
    qualified name in there, after all.
  * Display the welcome banner and final message at high priority so they
    will still be visible.
  * Rename the log file to base-config.log.
  * Remove console tools removal code for serial consoles, d-i just doesn't
    install it in that case.
  * The console-tools keymap file has changed from
    /etc/console-tools/default.kmap.gz to /etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz.
    Probably Closes: #212440, #212448 (I'd appreciate some more testing.)
  * Rename KEEP_BASE_DEBS to KEEP_DEBS and make it disable all apt-get clean
    calls in base-config. Closes: #217814
  * If the user includes non-free, always pull in contrib. Conversly, if they
    do not pick non-free, then ask about contrib at a low priority. There
    are a few things in contrib that do not depend on non-free.
    Closes: #209403
  * Move Mirrors.masterlist to libdir so it will be copied to tmp with
    everything else.
  * Clarified the PPP question.
  * Propigate exit code from apt-setup out to menu to allow fallback.
  * Make tzsetup exit 30 if backed up past its start.
  * Similar changes to finish, hostname, intro, pkgsel, pon.
  * Bugs filed on console-data, passwd, exim4-config, to get them to exit
    30 appropriatly as well. This leaves only apt-get that in general you
    cannot back up from.
  * Turn on capb backup for all of base-config.
  * Make base-config itself exit 30 if you back up from the main menu.
  * Urgency medium because this will get little testing before it is in
    testing, and because some of the unfiled bugs fixed above are really
    release critical.

base-config (1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the question about removing pcmcia. It was a bit confusing, and
    is fairly unnecessary, really. There is plenty of other cruft in base that
    could be removed if one wants a minimal base system, and aptitude is
    available at install time to easily do that if one wants to. Taking a
    question out of the critical path is a good thing.

base-config (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload for unstable *only*.
  * Added aptitude as an option, and reworked the package selection stage.
    Note: debian/templates translations need to be updated.
    Aptitude features online docs which Closes: #101074, well enough.
  * Added a dep on aptitude.
  * Changed debconf template merging to merge each of the three sets of
    templates in turn; this can work with the new debconf-mergetemplate.
  * Build-dep on debconf-utils 1.1.1.
  * Tired of all the bug reports about non-us and since non-us is increasingly
    less important these days and will not be worth bothering a new user about
    by the time sarge is released, I have disabled the code in apt-setup
    that deals with it. Closes: #60879 and 7 others
  * Capitalize Internet. Closes: #136334
  * Added 100 to all return codes of base-config subprograms, so things like
    a return code of 10 from debconf slipping in (as it did disastrously with
    version 1.33.17..) doesn't cause it to loop back to stage 10 or whatever.
    The 110-200 range is set aside for internal errors in debconf, which
    should be much rarer, and in fact debconf currently only uses code 100,
    which base-config explicitly ignores.
  * debhelper v4
  * Updated da translation of all templates.

base-config (1.33.16) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Upload to fix breakage in boot-floppies 3.0.22. If boot-floppies tells
    us "testing" is being installed, change it to woody, so users will not

    after debian 3.0 is released.

  * Corrected order templates are given to debconf-mergetemplate,

  * Removed tzsetup.templates.ru, too old to live.

  * Set LANG=C when calling date in tzsetup: Closes: #131473
  * Moved "enter information manually" to the top of the country list so it's
    not hidden at the bottom. In the dialog frontend (commonest case), this
    will make the default country appear above it, and all others under it. In
    other frontends it will work differently, and some may even hide it at the
    _top_ of the list, when they highlight the default near the end. Still,

  * Removed the LANGUAGE stuff; LANGUAGE is not the correct variable for LANG.
    Instead, export LANG if it's set after sourcing debootstrap_settings.
    This will make it available to everything run by base-config.

base-config (1.33.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'm _really_ not sure if this belongs in testing or not. Probably not.
  * Don't ask about emoving pcmcia if pcmcia-cs is not installed. Thanks to
    Matt Krai. Closes: #125831 Note that some arch's don't have pcmcia at all,
    so this is a nice feature.
  * Also don't bother asking about that if it's not a new install.
  * Have script log timing data as well. This makes it possible to play
    back a whole base-config run in real-time. Closes: #121286
    There's also a replaylog hack in the source package that replays one
    screen-worth at a time, which is sometimes more useful.

base-config (1.33.7) woody-proposed-updates unstable; urgency=low

  * Uploading to w-p-u since the base-config in testing does not offer the

base-config (1.33.4) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Set up ppp even if /etc/ppp/peers/provider exists, if it is a template.
    This is probably RC if we want ppp installs to work, thus the severity.
  * Source dbootstrap_settings and set LANG to the installation language
    (no effect if language_chooser is not enabled in the boot floppies).

base-config (1.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * base-config.8: Documented (most) of the environment variables that effect
    the program.
  * 00debootstrap_settings: If DEBIAN_PRIORITY is set, ignore the value from
    debootstrap_settings. This allows overriding of the priority at the boot
    prompt in the middle of a debian install, which is pretty neat.
  * base-config: Added a KEEP_BASE_DEBS, which, if set to yes, will inhibit
    the deletion of the apt cache when base-config runs on a new install. This
    can be passed to lilo or whatever. Thanks to bod for the idea, which hits
    exactly the mix of unobtrusiveness and functionality I wanted.
  * 75apt-get: Don't run apt-get clean, and let the dselect method prompt
    about this, as disgusting as that is.

base-config (1.31) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Corrected a typo in 75apt-get ($NOCLEAN -> $CLEAN), that was making it
    clean up the downloaded debs even if the apt run failed sometimes. Also,
    only clean up debootstrap debs before the initial apt run, not before
    further retries. This fixes blindman's problem with download timeouts, 
    but does not address the original issue in wishlist bug #103302. This 
    does need to get into testing soonish; making base-config usable for 
    dialup users is RC. Also Closes: #117741
  * This rebuild freshens the Mirrors.masterlist, Closes: #117706
  * Removed the code that makes it enter dselect if you opt out of tasksel. It
    is evidently more trouble than it's worth especially when someone is
    trying to use base-config in noninteractive mode. Closes: #119003

base-config (1.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * More s/390 hackery, in tzsetup -- hwclock is not supported on this 
    architecture, (though it is still installed currently), so if hwclock
    does not exist, don't try to use it, and if uname -m = s390, don't use
    it. No hu-hu, all I have to do is disable the ASKUTC code path.
    Closes: #115020
  * Marcin Owsiany:
    - updated Polish templates' translations
    - a few tiny typographic and typo fixes in original manpages
    - translated apt-setup.8, base-config.8, termwrap.8, tzsetup.8
      to Polish
    - changed the pattern in debian/rules to catch translated man
      pages
  * I told Marcin wrong, man pages should be ll.8, not 8.ll.

base-config (1.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Gerhard Tonn <GerhardTonn@swol.de> to deal with s/390
    installs of debian, which involve telnetting into the system to do the
    install, since its console is so primative that, while debconf will
    hopefully work on it soon, a lot of other stuff has no chance of
    working, ever. This only affects base-config in that at the very end it
    needs to disable the telnet hacks for the s/390. Let's put it in a
    separate 98s390 script. I'm going to ship the script for all arch's, 
    though later I might want to make this an arch all package and only
    include it for s390. Dunno. Closes: #113856

base-config (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added backtracking support to base-config.
  * Renumbered the lib/ scripts so they start at 10. (cvs hates me)
  * Backtrack from apt-get to stage 50 (tasksel) if it fails, to let the
    user change their package selections in case something is just not
    working out or they are too low on disk space.
  * Attempted to clarify the GMT question; tzsetup does not set the
    hardware clock, it just lets you specify if it is set to GMT or not.
  * Fixed tzsetup to not run hwclock.sh until after the timezone files have
    been set up. If it's run before that point, and the hw clock is on
    localtime, the time gets screwed up because hwclock does not apply the
    proper reverse timezone offset to counteract the timezone setting. At
    least, I think that's what's going on. Anyone really understand this
    stuff? Thanks to Matt Kraai for bringing this to my attention.

    current base-config invocation still finish cleanly.
  * Moved inittab stuff into a lib file, as there is no need to have it
    directly in base-config.
  * Only trap signals in second-stage install, *not* when base-config is
    being run by hand. Closes: #100454

base-config (1.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved all templates into templates file in control archive. This
    should not be a problem now, since the postinst does use debconf.
    It fixes a bug in 00debootstrap_settings, which tried to modify various
    apt-setup questions before they were in the debconf database.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Jun 2001 17:27:32 -0400

base-config (1.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added GMT prompting and setting to tzsetup.
  * Fixed some other tzsetup bugs.
  * Added a quick little introductory message before base-config runs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Jun 2001 13:56:50 -0400

base-config (1.03) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added tzsetup, a tzconfig clone that uses debconf. Call it early in the
    base-config process, to set up a time zone. This functionality is no
    longer in the boot floppies.
  * Tzsetup tickles an obscure debconf bug, so I'm afraid this package
    needs a versioned dep on debconf.
  * Call loadkeys with --quiet.
  * Reconfigure console-data instead of calling no longer existing
    kbdconfig.
  * Fixed ordering of some of the run-parts scripts.
  * Use new install-keymap command.
  * Depend on console-data, passwd, and tasksel too, since it invokes all
    of these.

base-config (1.01) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use debootstrap_settings SUITE variable to determine what suite
    apt-setup defaults to, Closes: #100153
  * Made 1console-tools quieter. See #100365.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Jun 2001 19:36:50 -0400

base-config (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote and reorganized everything. There is now a
    /usr/lib/base-config/ directory full of programs. The programs are ran,
    using run-parts, by /usr/sbin/base-config. This let me cleanly break up
    the morass of different things this package must do, worked around
    some debconf issues, and best of all it allows other packages to just
    drop scripts in there to add to the base configuration process. In
    fact, quite a lot of the scripts in there belong in other packages, and
    I intend to file wishlist bugs to that effect one day.
  * Anyway, /usr/sbin/base-config should be run by the boot-floppies
    installed inittab, rather than reconfiguring base-config. Reconfiguring
    base-config no longer does anything interesting!!
  * Removed all the password and useradd stuff. That has moved to the
    passwd package (currently a bit broken in there, since it never asks
    for root's password, but I'm sure it will be fixed, or that package will
    get some rc bugs :-).
  * Reworked package selection. First you get the chance to run tasksel,
    then the opportunity to use dselect to fine-tune the packages tasksel
    selects. Since task packages are dead, this actually works. Deity might
    be added as an option later, but I have not figured out how to
    interface to it.
  * All the translations are out of date again, sorry.
  * Removed a number of unused templates from the master template file,
    and fron the debconf db on upgrade.
  * Removed the checklock program, so this package is arch all.
  * Added man pages for everything.
  * Fixed trap so ctrl-c and so on don't kill base-config. Closes: #62830

base-config (0.68) unstable; urgency=low

base-config (0.65) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reworded the "simple, advanced" question, adding a third option
    to not install anything more. All translations need to be updated..
  * Removed PERL_BADLANG hack. If the boot floppies are not setting a
    proper LL_ll language code, and are setting LANG=LL instead, this will
    cause nasty perl messages. Let's find out..
  * Only ask about removing pcmcia if PCMCIA is set, but not "yes".
    If it is unset, this is probably not a fresh install (and having it
    always ask about removing pcmcia from my laptop during testing was
    getting to be a pita).

base-config (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Needs to have a versioned depend on debconf, since no version of
    debconf-tiny supports the seen flag, and older versions of debconf don't,
    either. I killed the debconf-tiny conflict this time.
  * Version 0.56 of this package got into testing by mistake, since it was
    missing the dependancy. It will continue to be broken for some time,
    until a new enough debconf gets into testing. This sucks, but I can't
    do anything really to fix it except wait. In the meantime, unstable
    will be ok. Closes: #88523

  * All right, it's time to whip this package into shape..
  * Use seen flag instead of isdefault flag.
  * Corrected a typo in the stop-ppp question asking code.
  * Added a check for use of NIS for root (shudder).
  * The config script does nothing when the package is initially installed
    or upgraded now, just when it is reconfigured. That should prevent a
    lot of potential problems. Closes: #79336, #65097, #72508, #77551, #78653

base-config (0.31) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Also set up md5 password stuff in /etc/pam.d/passwd. This fixes the
    following bug: You install Debian and enable md5 passwords. A month later,
    your password exipres, and you find that you cannot change it, because
    login doesn't grok md5 passwords. Whether this is RC or not, I leave up
    to dark; my opinions is it's a pretty bad sleeper bug. Closes: #64575
  * In apt setup, don't refer to the last item on a list; the dialog frontend
    may order it to the top if it is default. Closes: #64567

base-config (0.28) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed postinst to call anXious rather than xviddetect (randolph),
    I think the boot-floppies people consider this RC, since it makes new
    installs actually have niceties like a window manager and xterm when
    they start X. cf, bug #63114
  * Fixed problem with wrong error message being shown if an empty user
    password was entered, and only prompt for user password repeat at high,
    not critical priority. Closes: #64163
  # Added German translation from Othmar Pasteka <pasteka@kabsi.at>.
  * Added Polish translation from Marcin Owsiany
    <porridge@pandora.info.bielsko.pl>.
  * Added Italian translation from Eugenia Franzoni <franzoni@edisons.it>
    Closes: #64162
  * All right, I give up. Added text to initial root password prompt saying
    that it will not echo what you type, to reassure all the weird people
    out there who expect to see some kind of _infomation leaking echo_ when
    they enter the _root password for their system_. Gaaaaaaaaaaagh!
    Closes: #60444 and probably #63778

  * If the user specifies that md5 passwords should be used, actually use
    them when setting passwords. This was not being done because chpasswd
    doesn't know how. Now I pass it an already crypted password. I think this
    is important enough to go into potato because it tends to be a security
    problem. base-config claims to be using md5 passwords; to not do so
    gives the user a false sense of security. Closes: #62452
  * Tweaked message about VT switching so it will make sense to mac folks.
    Closes: #62829
  * Just refer to "Debian", rather than "Debian GNU/Linux" or "Debian
    Linux" in several places. Closes: #62544
  * Pcmcia purging has been fixed for quite some time, Closes: #58150
  * Display notes if entered passwords don't match or are empty, or if the
    entered username is invalid. Closes: #61372

base-config (0.26) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * There are critical path fixes below -- bugs that will affect nearly all
    new debian (CD) installs, and would require nasty hacking to work around.
    Since that would make debian basically unistallable by some classes of
    users, this needs to get into frozen.
  * Finally got a chance to test all the cd stuff, using 2 potato cd's, a
    random non-debian cd, and a blank un-burned cd. Fixed the following
    bugs:
    - After successfully scanning cds, prompt the user if they want to
      add another access method or not, instead of looping back to main
      menu. Closes: #58531, #61953
    - Don't exit apt-setup if scanning a second or later cd and a bad cd is
      inserted.
    - If scanning first cd and a non-debian cd is inserted, don't go into
      infinite loop, just inform the user, and go back to main screen.
      Closes: #56414
    - Autoprobe for cd on apt-setup start (I had forgotten to pass "probe"
      parameter, oops.).
    - Unmount each cd after scanning it.
    - Make the /dev/cdrom link if it doesn't exist and the user specifies a
      cd device. Closes: #62101
    - Touch /etc/apt/sources.list before running apt-cdrom. Otherwise, that
      program would bail if the file is missing (file should never be
      missing, but..)
    - Wording fixes here and there to make prompts clearer.

    it made apt-setup not work on 75 mirrors.. Closes: #57763 (grave)
  * apt-setup now returns 1 if the user backs up past the first dialog, and
    config now detects this and goes back a step. Also, after running
    apt-setup, reset the title. Closes: #57536
  * Now supports http proxies. Closes: #56861, #56887

base-config (0.16) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Release manager: this needs to go into frozen for the same reason
    boot-floppies releases still go into frozen -- some of the bugfixes below
    can prevent installation of Debian for people, and are thus critical bug
    fixes even though the bugs are not so marked. Others are critical
    usability fixes.
  * Call tasksel with new -r and -i flags, to mark all required and important
    packages for install automatically.
  * Prompt for full username with medium priority, not low. Closes: #56602
  * apt-setup changes:
    - First try just adding the "deb" entry. If that succeeds, try
      adding the "deb-src" entry also, but if that fails, keep the working
      "deb" entry. Closes: #53440, #56934
    - Remove tempfiles.
    - Removed "nfs server" from list since it confused people.
    - Instead of "manual entry", I now have "edit sources list by hand",
      which just runs an editor on sources.list and tests the result, since
      many people complained the earlier interface wasn't powerful enough.
    - Changed "aptconf" to "apt-setup" in template names.
    - Added support for non-us. This is pretty rudimentry for now; it always
      uses non-us.debian.org. Full support for chosing a non-us mirror will
      be added for woody. Closes: #53439
  * Clear the screen on exit and in several places inside apt-setup
    Closes: #56666
  * TODO list updates.

base-config (0.14) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually set root and user passwords to something other than ""!
    Major big fix.
  * Fixed typo that was preventing deletion of /root/dbootstrap_settings.
  * Fixed keymap loading.
  * Fixed title in postinst debconf stuff.
  * Fixed "or $user" display to have a space after it.
  * Removed 2 useless uses of cat.
  * I thought I uploaded this already as version 0.13, but it looks like I
    goofed up and did not.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Jan 2000 12:01:00 -0800

base-config (0.12) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't try to add a user in NIS environements, Closes: #55772
  * Fixed debconf reentryancy problem when packages were installed under
    dpkg-reconfigure. This was nasty, I had to reorganize the whole
    postinst, and split large parts of it out into helper scripts.
  * Fixed pcmcia purging.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jan 2000 10:33:51 -0800

base-config (0.11) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Another upload on the Boot-Floppies Freeze Exemption Plan (TM). I hope
    this one is almost the last for this package..
  * Added keymap setting and loading support, I think this is the last chunk
    of code to be moved over from boot-floppies' .bash_profile.
  * Shut up db_clear, Closes: #55718 (Larzarous still has some real bug, but
    since he is unable to answer any email or provide any other info about it,
    I will let his existing 4 other bug reports on the topic stand open.)
  * Er. Make that 5 other bug reports. Sigh.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jan 2000 23:33:57 -0800

base-config (0.10) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified to use /root/dboostrap_settings file if present. That file
    is created by the boot-floppies install process.
  * Run tasksel in queue mode.
  * If it looks like they want X based on what is selected in tasksel, use
    xviddetect to guess the xserver to load after tasksel runs, and select
    it for installation.
  * Then, run apt to install everything that has been selected.

base-config (0.09) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Only works with debconf 2.0.78 or higher, since it uses CLEAR.
  * Reworded the question about running tasksel.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Jan 2000 19:19:14 -0800

base-config (0.08) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Needs to go info frozen for the same reason new boot-floppies do.
  * Reorder the question flow. Ask about md5 first, then shadow, then root,
    etc. Actually turn md5 on/off in the config script. This allows for m5d
    root passwords.
  * Run adduser noninteractively, meshes much better with the overall feel.
  * Shortened the root password prompt (moving part of it to the add a user
    prompt), so it all fits on one screen in a dialog.
  * Use clear command, so depends on debconf 0.2.77
  * Fixed test for /etc/shadow.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Jan 2000 14:27:37 -0800

base-config (0.07) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Prevented nasty infinite loop if apt-setup was run in noninteractive
    mode.
  * Inserted blank line between 2 items in concacentated templates file.
  * Changed default distribution apt-setup uses to potato. I can't use
    stable yet; using unstable is out; if I use frozen things break if it's
    not changed to stable just before release; so potato is the best choice
    of a bad lot. This should be changed to "stable" just before we release,
    but if that isn't possible, "potato" will continue to work, and it can
    be fixed in an update to the new stable at a later date.
  * Yes, this has to go into frozen. It's effectivly part of boot-floppies,
    and will be under development for a while yet..

base-config (0.06) frozen unstable; urgenc=low

  * Sigh. The dpkg database is *not* locked when packages are preconfigured in
    an apt run. Thus my lock-checking program is worthless when run in the
    config script, and things still go south, completly screwing up apt when
    this package is installed. This is a critical bug.
  * To fix the bug, I used a new approach: only do the things that can mess
    up apt when this package is being reconfigured. It's a 1 line change.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Jan 2000 16:15:16 -0800

base-config (0.05) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Swapped binary-indep and binary-arch targets. Closes: #54972

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Jan 2000 13:03:28 -0800

base-config (0.04) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now arch any, because I include a tiny utility to tell me if the dpkg
    database is locked. Using apt to do this didn't work and caused Jason
    and me no end of pain. Closes: #54708, #54723
  * Fixed running of apt-setup (typo).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Jan 2000 20:23:05 -0800

base-config (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't run apt-setup if it doesn't exist (duh).
  * Don't ask about shadow passwords if /etc/shadow exists, unless this
    package is being reconfigured.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Jan 2000 18:12:19 -0800

base-config (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Typos.
  * Redirect apt noise to /dev/null.
  * I think the last message will be displayed correctly now.
  * Can be reconfigured once it is installed onto a debian system, and it
    actually does something sane.
  * Added README.Debian
  * Moved apt setup call to a more consitent place.
  * Run pppconfig on a tty.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Jan 2000 15:47:47 -0800

base-config (0.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release. Yeah, this violates the no-new-packages rule, but it is
    essential this goes into potato; boot-floppies are going to use it.
