  [ Philip Hands ]
  * add /etc/preseed_aliases file, and code to env2debconf to handle it
    Closes: #251424

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Removed the DEBCONF_PRIORITY hack. Use debconf/priority= (or now just
    priority=) instead.
  * Support running preseed/early_command in initrd preseeding.

preseed (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add preseed/run, based on Philip Hands's patch.
  * Minor wording change to preseed/load_error so it can be used for errors
    from preseed/run too instead of adding a whole new error template.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Reword "preseed file" to "preconfiguration file"

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Move prebaseconfig script from 05 to 07, this places it after
    user-setup and tzsetup, which could be useful for late_command,
    without putting it so late that in_target won't work. Closes: #369736
  * prebaseconfig transition

preseed (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Geert Stappers ]
  * Allow the URL to a preseed file to be specified as the filename in
    the DHCP lease. The filename must contain "://" to be used as an URL.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Don't ignore the last continued line.
  * When extracting filename from DHCP lease, be sure to quote it to prevent
    accidents.
  * Look for dhcp lease files in turn, not based on which dhcp client is
    found, to avoid tight binding to which one netcfg prefers to run.
  * Load dhcp preseed file first, but then load any specified preseed/url.
    This allows for using dhcp preseeding for network-global stuff, like
    mirrors etc, while fully automating installs in the old manner. Note that
    I chose to let preseed/url override the dhcp preseeding; which should
    override the other is debatable. Also, there is some code duplication
    between network-preseed.isinstallable and network-preseed.postinst.

  * If preseed/url/checksum, preseed/file/checksum, or

    the preseed files, which can add some security/robustness to preseeding.
    (Note that checksums are not supported for preseed/include_command

  * Colin Watson
    - Add preseed/interactive question, allowing you to preseed default
      answers to questions but still have them asked. Needs di-utils 1.09.
  * Joey Hess
    - Move debconf-set-selections to preseed-common, remove dep on di-utils.
      Only preseed seems to use it, so might as well concentrate preseeding
      stuff here.
    - Add a new env-preseed udeb, gather the bits from rootskel and
      di-utils that were used for (boot-time) environment overriding of
      debconf values (env2debconf and the init script that runs it), and
      move them into this new udeb.
    - Log variables preseeded from the environment in the preseed log file,
      but leave them commented out, since environment preseeding is typically
      used for one-off overridding, and we don't want preseeded
      debconf/priority or the like to affect the installed system. Probably.
