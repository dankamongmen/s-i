    - Fix a couple of compiler warnings in the stack driver.
    - Set config_passwd_db path in example cdebconf.conf to passwords.dat
      rather than templates.dat.
    - Attempt to read cdebconf.conf configuration tags with quote-removal
      (strparsecword) and only try without quote-removal (strparsequoteword)
      if that fails. The strange function naming wasn't my idea ... Fixes
      incorrect parsing of stack driver parts of example cdebconf.conf.
    - Initialise next pointers in template/question stacks properly.
    - Implement accept_types and reject_types in stack driver.

    - Set NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT on multiselect checkboxes (closes: #252751).
    - Fix compiler warning in text frontend.
    - gtk frontend work:
      + Set window title on GO.
      + Make cdebconf-gtk-udeb packaging work (still not built by default).
      + Make the Forward button the default widget, so that pressing Enter

  * Colin Watson
    - gtk frontend work (not built for sarge, so no risk):
      + Allocate choices, choices_translated, and defvals dynamically. Fixes
        several crash bugs.
      + Fix a type mismatch that generated a compiler warning.
      + Disable help popup on multiselects, since it made it impossible to
        actually select anything. Ditto on password keyboard focus grab.
      + Implement the text type, just as an alias of note for now.
      + Drop the old back/continue buttons entirely, as they only appear
        sometimes and having both them and the druid-style buttons is very
        confusing. Fix sensitivity of druid-style buttons.

    - Add a --merge command-line flag to debconf-loadtemplate.

      behavior is to replace existing templates with the new
      definitions.  With this flag, translations are added to already

    - Major improvements to the text frontend:
      + '\r' is not supported by all terminals, which made progress bars
        unreadable.  The display is now:
          Progress bar title ..20%..40%..60%..80%..100%
        Closes: #195704
      + Add support for backing up.  Closes: #183107
      + For most questions, prints the short description below the extended
        one.
      + String and passwd questions accept an empty answer.
      + A contextual help message is available at prompt.
      + Progress bar refresh is set to a minimum of 10% to prevent
        too verbose output.
      + Select and multiselect questions look now more like debconf
        readline questions.
      + Define a ISEMPTY macro to deal with empty strings on s390.
    - The previous fix about the seen flag broke when a package is
      left half-configured.  To prevent this problem, the seen
      flag is never written to the questions.dat file (for cdebconf-udeb
      only) as suggested by Joey Hess.  Closes: #229648
    - Add a --enable-d-i flag to the configure script, invoked when
      building cdebconf-udeb.  This option add -DDI_UDEB to CFLAGS.

      When backup is disabled, the <Continue> button is now centered.
      The <Yes>/<No> buttons in boolean questions are separated from
      the <Go Back> button.
    - With progress bars, minimal text height is set to 2, so that
      there is no box redrawing when 1 or 2 line long text is displayed.
    - If title is larger than other widgets, it was not displayed.
      Main window is now enlarged in such a case so that title becomes

    - In the choices splitter, support "\ " as a way to have leading
      whitespace that is not stripped out. Did it this way because
      changing it to split on ", " instead of "*, *" might break stuff,
      and the spec is very vague.

      the "Create %s file system" problem in partconf. (Closes: #224493)
  * Denis Barbier
    - Steal code from debconf to go back over skipped questions.
      Closes: #225861, #229719
    - As locales are not installed during early stage of installation,
      sorting cannot be performed at run-time, and templates must
      contain sorting order.  Thus the Listorder fields is removed and
      replaced by a new Indices field.  If a template contains
        Choices: a, b, c
        Choices-ll.UTF-8: x, y, z
        Indices-ll.UTF-8: 3, 1, 2
      this means that 'a' is translated into 'x', 'b' into 'y' and 'c'
      into 'z' for the language 'll', but "z, x, y" is displayed in that
      order.
    - If frontend is set to 'none', a dummy frontend is initialized.
      This can be useful in conjunction with debconf-communicate, e.g.
      to fix #223344.
    - Only newt and text frontends are currently supported.  Do not
      build other packages (neither debs nor udebs), and strip build
      dependencies.
      The dependency problem caused by cdebconf-gtk-udeb goes away,
      and a solution is worked on in case this frontend is back later
      (which is the reason why these entries are not removed from
      debian/control), so there is no need to keep this bugreport open.

      now fixed for all supported frontends.  Closes: #219072.
    - With the newt frontend, display of notes was corrupted when the
      extended description was shorter than the description.
      Closes: #218869.
    - Look for translated Listorder fields so that translators may decide
      not to sort Choices fields, e.g.
        Listorder-ja.UTF-8: none
      will prevent sorting in Japanese.

cdebconf (0.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Denis Barbier
    - Sort translated choices when a select/multiselect template contains
      a line Listorder: lexicographic
      If some Choices items must not be sorted, they can be prepended with
      an exclamation mark.  Adding a comment is a good idea to let
      translators know why this sign has been put here:
        _Choices: ${FOO}, !Other[ You only have to translate Other, remove the exclamation mark and this comment between brackets]
      Currently text, newt, slang and gtk frontends support this feature.
    - Fix a crash with the newt frontend when a boolean question has no
      default value. Closes: #215583.
    - Let cdebconf newt frontend looks like debconf dialog: short description
      is moved just before input field, except for note and error template
      types.  Closes: #215582.
    - Make strlongest aware of wide chars.
    - Windows now adjust to text size with the newt frontend,
  * Steinar H. Gunderson
    - Makes cdebconf assume "show only unseen questions" by default,

      unattended installs (ie. installs with pre-seeded debconf databases)
      possible without a non-interactive frontend.
    - Updated dpkg-reconfigure to make cdebconf show unseen questions,
      to keep it updated with the change above.

    - Redesign the command functions to get rid of the space mangling.
      (Closes: #185014)
    - Add DEBCONF_OLD_{STDIN,STDOUT}_FD that point to the original stdin

    - frontends/newt: Change OK/Cancel to Continue/Go Back, and lay some
      ground work for i18n.
    - Redesign the progress API, see the docs. (Closes: #188243)

    - Update /usr/share/debconf/confmodule to match the version in
      debconf 1.2.34.  This might solve the problem on disappearing
      whitespace.  The only difference left is the progress support.
    - Try to change the language imediately when debconf/language is
      set.
    - Add asserts() in question_get_field() trying to find out why
      cdebconf crashes.

    - when SIGUSR1 is received, reads debian-installer/language value
      and sets LANGUAGE environment variable accordingly.
    - change progress bars interface: displayed strings are extracted
      from a template in order to help their l10n.

    - Remove a superfluous trailing space in extended descriptions
    - Use LANGUAGE environment variable instead of DEBCONF_LANG.
      This variable is a colon separated list of languages.
    - Fix the textdb driver wrt localized fields
    - Support localized Default fields
    - There are now 2 ways to retrieve question values, question_getvalue(q,l)
      return either NULL or question value if it exists, and
      question_get_field(q,l,"value") always return a valid string.  With the
      latter, variable substitutions are also performed.
    - Add support for the DEBCONF_SHOWOLD environment variable.  Its default
      is currently "true".
    - Improve support of the 'seen' flag; dixit joeyh, flags should be
