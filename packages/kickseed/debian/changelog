  * Moved to d-i SVN; maintaining it here henceforth.
  * Update copyright dates.
  * Remove Ubuntu-specific hostname in setup/net.
  * Unbrand an Ubuntu-specific error message.
  * Remove some old base-config cruft.
  * The Ubuntu standard tasks are now just called 'standard', and this makes
    more sense for Debian too.

kickseed (0.45) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Make ksdevice=link equivalent to leaving out ksdevice, since that's
    netcfg's default behaviour.
  * Make ksdevice=bootif emit a warning and be equivalent to leaving out
    ksdevice for now. Once netcfg supports being preseeded with a MAC
    address, this can be supported.
  * Support 'part swap --recommended' (thanks, Rohit Kumar Mehta).
  * I'm not sure how swap partition preseeding ever worked, because the
    filesystem slot in the recipe is supposed to be "linux-swap", not
    "swap". Fixed.

kickseed (0.44) feisty; urgency=low

  * Support --interpreter for %post scripts without --nochroot (pointed out
    by Jérôme Benois).
  * Fix broken %post argument parsing.
  * Run kickseed_post in test-kickseed again; this time, print a notice when
    a post-installation handler would be run.
  * Add Lintian override for no-standards-version-field; udebs don't need
    that.

  * Make 'clearpart --all' write out a partman auto.d script to clear the

  * test-kickseed: Explicitly source kickseed.sh from current directory.
  * Update keyboard handling for console-setup; note that keymap names have

    keymap names may be used (closes: Malone #61573).

  * Update crypted user and root password handling for passwd 1:4.0.13-5.

  * Display an error if we can't fetch the Kickstart file from HTTP/FTP, or

    massively faster since we aren't running the usual userspace support.

  * Send warnings during installation to syslog, not stderr.
  * Fix handler arguments in the case where no arguments were passed to a
    command.
  * Fix langsupport to conform to Kickstart documentation and Anaconda.
    - If no non-option arguments were passed to langsupport, support all
      locales, per the Kickstart documentation. Yes, this will be slow. In
      that case, default to en_US.UTF-8 if there's no default set either,
      per Anaconda.
    - Otherwise, default to the first locale selected if there's no default
      set, per Anaconda.
  * Tolerate %pre and %post scripts exiting non-zero (log a warning rather
    than exiting).

  * Very basic package group support, mapping package groups to tasks. Any
    package group name not containing a space causes the task of the same
    name to be installed; as special cases, "Ubuntu Desktop" and "Kubuntu
    Desktop" install the ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop tasks
    respectively; any other package group name triggers a warning.

  * Make partman automatically partition without confirmation when
    partitions have been defined.

  * Attempt to handle case where no growing partitions have been defined
    more gracefully. Changes to partman-auto will be required to do this
    properly, I think.

  * Implement ksdevice= to set the network interface used by netcfg.
  * Add support for ks=hd:<device>:/<file> to read a Kickstart file from a
    vfat or ext2 partition on an arbitrary device (although actually some
    other filesystems will probably work too). Requires anna 1.06ubuntu5.
  * Split out /proc/cmdline handling into /lib/kickseed/cmdline.sh.

kickseed (0.6) hoary; urgency=low

  * Merge file-kickseed and network-kickseed into initrd-kickseed. If
    reading a Kickstart file from CD-ROM or the network, install (using

    to make sure that the requested file is accessible.

  * Implement cdrom (a no-op, assuming that everyone using this will be
    booting with the cdrom initrd).
  * Implement clearpart --all, assuming for now that this means just the
    first disk; getting partman-auto to deal with multiple disks appears to
    be difficult. I'm not sure if this will work properly with e.g. USB
    installs.
  * Add a file-kickseed package to allow loading Kickstart files from CD-ROM
