console-setup (1.24) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Support for X key types such as PC_CONTROL_LEVEL2 and PC_ALT_LEVEL2.
    Never use ShiftR.  Thanks to Alexander E. Patrakov, closes: #484822.
    Urgency medium because #484822 is related to the default settings used
    by d-i for some languages.
  * Improved support for non 'KP_...' keys in the keypad block.
  * console-setup-mini and udebs: fix some bugs in modifiers in
    precompiled non-latin layouts
  * Support for some new X key symbols (some of them spelling errors).
  * ckbcomp: accept a list after virtual_modifiers
  * Debconf support for grp:alt_caps_toggle, grp:lctrl_lshift_toggle,
    grp:sclk_toggle, lv3:alt_switch, lv3:enter_switch, compose:lwin
  * Removed debconf support for grp:alts_toggle, grp:ctrls_toggle,
    grp:shifts_toggle, grp:shift_caps_toggle as it is impossible to
    support them on the console.
  * update Keyboard/ckb with the keyboard data of xkb-data version 1.3-1
    (this syncs console-setup-mini and udebs with the main package)
  * xmlreader: ignore tags languageList and countryList.
  * Remove dh_installxfonts from debian/rules.

console-setup (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Correct dependency info in init.d scripts to make sure they start
    after console-screen and keymap. Closes: #475826.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Map dead_stroke to U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS.
  * Support XKB rules with multiple consequents (thanks, Adam Simpkins;
    LP: #139710).
  * Allow specifying alternate rules using XKBRULES (thanks, Adam Simpkins;
    LP: #139712).

console-setup (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Proofread and correct debconf templates (LP: #181860).
  * Treat 'any' as a synonym for 'NoSymbol' in XKB input files (LP: #93077).

  [ Piarres Beobide ]
  * Debconf Basque translation. Closes: #469650

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Add support for PA Semi's evaluation systems (#464429). Thanks to
    Olof Johansson for the patch.

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Use boottime.kmap.gz instead of ckbcomp in setupcon only if the
    default configuration is requested and boottime.kmap.gz is not older
    than /etc/default/console-setup.  The package has used
    boottime.kmap.gz since version 1.20.  This closes: #473217.
  * ckbcomp: define X key codes 214-217 for AT keyboards (multimedia,
    hence fake keys).  Thanks to Michael Biebl, Christoph Anton Mitterer
    and Juhapekka Tolvanen, closes: #444488.
  * Return the template configuration file in the udeb.
  * Update README.fonts - Terminus now supports Greek.  Add depends
    console-terminus > 4.26.
  * Install the manpages for ckbcomp and setupcon also in
    console-setup-mini.

console-setup (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Silently ignore 'vendor' tag in xorg.xml.
  * Use 'chomp' rather than 'chop' in ckbcomp to deal with XKB symbols files
    that are missing their final newline (closes: #461191).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jan 2008 12:58:25 +0000

console-setup (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Set default model to pc105 on powerpc/ps3 and powerpc/cell systems.
  * Clean up the package description a little.
  * Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
    *_CA locales (LP: #64418).
  * Improve ckbcomp(1) formatting.
  * Run setupcon with --save in the postinst to ensure that required data is
    copied to /etc.
  * Load the saved keymap in /etc/console-setup/boottime.kmap.gz if
    available rather than running ckbcomp (which is slow), unless we're
    being called with --save or --save-only.

  [ Debconf templates translations ]
  * Belarusian. Closes: #447109
  * Galician. Closes: #447940
  * Russian.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Correct "Provides:" in console-setup init script to allow insserv
    to insert console-setup properly in the boot sequence.
    Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for the patch. Closes: #458486
  * Add the required "Default-Stop" and "Required-Stop" fields in the
    init.d/console-setup script.
  * Set myself as Uploader.
  * Fixing lintian warnings:
    - Remove "perl, libxml-parser-perl" from Build-Depends. They were
      duplicated in Build-Depends-Indep
    - Do not ignore non-zero exit status of "make maintainer-clean" in the
      clean target
    - Turn console-setup/dont_ask_layout into an error template. That'll
      get rid of the lintian warning and this is more accurate anyway.
  * Fixing lintian errors:
    - No longer install an example file in 
      /usr/share/doc/console-setup-mini/examples/console-setup
      for the udeb package

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Correct "provides" header in init.d/keyboard-setup too.
  * Correct dependencies of init.d/keyboard-setup and
    init.d/console-setup to reflect their intended start sequence.
  * Add the required "Default-Stop" and "Required-Stop" fields in the
    init.d/keyboard-setup script.
  * Update standards-version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3.  No changes needed.
  * Add lintian override to make it that
    /usr/share/console-setup/KeyboardNames.pl is not executable.

console-setup (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a manual page for ckbcomp.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,
    closes: #405005. 
  * Apply a patch by Colin Watson:
    - enable udebs;
    - remove unhelpful defaults for several questions;
    - allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode,
      console-setup/layoutcode, console-setup/variantcode,
      console-setup/optionscode, and console-setup/fontsize;
    - remove outdated note about loadkeys in console-setup-udeb's
      description;
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb
      borrowed from kbd-chooser. 
    I disabled the code for making UTF-8 default charmap in d-i because
    there are locales which use other charmap.  However I made setupcon to
    always use UTF-8 in d-i environment.
  * Updated French and Dutch translations, new Portuguese.  Thanks to
    Pedro Ribeiro, Jean-Luc Coulon and Bart Cornelis.

  * Update ckbconf with the most recent list of xkeysyms.
  * Thanks to Colin Watson and Ubuntu team for the many bugs and
    improvements fixed in this release.  Patches were provided by Colin
    Watson:

      closes: #420831.
    - Remove from the source package several directories
      debian/UDEB-PACKAGE-NAME.  (The udebs were removed from
      debian/control before running the clean target.)  Closes: #420912.
    - Map fr_CH locale to Swiss French default keyboard
      layout in config.proto.  Closes: #420828.
    - Pass xkbdir variable on the make-command line, because else its
      value is overriden and the keymap definitions in Keyboard/ckb are
      used.  Closes: #420827.
    - A new option --save-only for setupcon.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker.  Closes: #420914.
    - Fix Esperanto locale check in config.proto, closes: #420785.  Make

      Closes: #420802.  
    - Use 'jp(latin)' instead of 'us' in the Latin mode of Japanese
      keyboards.  Override the keyboard model if it was chosen by default
      and the layout is Japanese or Brasilian.  Closes: #420824.
    - Add --save-only option to setupcon.  Closes: #420832.

      if they are not in the xml database.  Closes: #420821.
    - Talk about 'national' instead of 'non-Latin' mode in the templates.
      Treat the Lithuanian keyboard as a two-mode keyboard similarly to
      the Serbian keyboard.  Closes: #421261.

    Thanks to Karsten Hilbert, closes: #421796.
  * Two additions to the FAQ:
    - Add a suggestion for the VBERestore option.  Thanks to Dmitry
      Semyonov, closes: #402143.
    - Document CapsLock working as ShiftLock in Unicode mode.
  * Added manual page for setupcon.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,
    closes: #405005.

  * Remove the udebs in order to make the migration from unstable to
    testing automatic.
  * Update the version of the Terminus font from 4.16 to 4.20.  (This is

    - make the purpose of the codeset question clearer.
  * Use user-friendly choices in the codeset question.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation of the templates.
  * Add some capital Greek letters to standard.equivalents and approximate

console-setup (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * setupcon: new option --force to skip the 'are we on the console'
    check.  To be used for d-i because there /proc/self/fd/2 points to
    pipe.  Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen.

    available.  Thanks to Colin Watson for the bug report and the patch,

    priority.  Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #386836.
  * config.proto(ask_debconf): when the provided default value is
    unavailable, try to use the empty string.  Useful when asking for the
    keyboard variant.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Updated French translation
  * Added Czech translation. Closes: #360333

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Keyboard/ckbcomp: include /usr/share/X11/xkb to the list of

    are still the default.
  * Sync the Keyboard/ckb data with the data in xkb-data package, version
    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).
  * Do not package the keyboard data.  Depend on xkb-data.  Thanks to
    Denis Barbier, closes: #359775.

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.
  * ckbcomp: Do not interpret xkeysyms such as F10, F11 and F12 as
    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.

    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used 
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
