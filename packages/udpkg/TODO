* Install a deb that has a failing postinst (libc6.deb into the demo system
  works well, and you see something like:

  ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
  postinst exited with status 256
  /mirror/debian/all/libc6_2.2-5.deb: No such file or directory

  The last line seems bogus, it did install the file after all.

* fix bugs
 1) Multiple packages are removed from status file. e.g.
  udpkg -r apt-move_4.1.13_i386.deb removes both apt and apt-move from the status file

 2) udpkg -i apt-move doesnt add all the fields to the status file that dpkg does.

 3) Improve error handling, when the disk is full at 'ar' and 'tar' fails.

* Check to see which of the above are really bugs. This TODO file is quite
  old..

* Integrate any useful changes from the branches/packages/udpkg/devel
  branch.
