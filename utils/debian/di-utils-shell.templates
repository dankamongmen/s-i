Description: Interactive shell.
  You are running "ash", a Bourne-shell clone. The root filesystem is a
  RAM disk. The hard disk filesystems are mounted on "/target".
  The editor available to you is sed (FIXME). It's very small
  and not easy to figure out - sorry. To get an idea of what Unix 
  utilities are available to you, run ls /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin\". 
  Use the "exit" command to return to the installation menu.
